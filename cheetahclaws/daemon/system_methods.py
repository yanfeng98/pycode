"""system_methods.py — Always-available daemon-control RPC methods.

These ride on top of the spike's :mod:`daemon.methods` (which carries
the demo and permission methods) so the contract surface is the same on
day one as it will be once the real ``agent.run`` integration lands.

  ``system.ping``      — returns the literal string ``"pong"``.
                          Same purpose as ``echo.ping`` but matches the
                          method name committed to in RFC 0001 and the
                          F-1 acceptance criteria.

  ``system.shutdown``  — triggers ``DaemonState.shutdown()`` which sets
                          ``shutdown_event``.  The cli.py serve loop
                          watches that event and, on a side thread,
                          invokes ``server.shutdown()`` so the ongoing
                          RPC response can finish writing before the
                          listener tears down.

                          This is the only cross-platform graceful
                          shutdown we have — Windows can't deliver
                          SIGTERM cleanly to another Python process, so
                          relying on signals would force users on Windows
                          to ``TerminateProcess`` (no clean cleanup).

  ``system.status``    — RFC 0002 §F-9.  Returns the four budget keys
                          (``session_token_budget`` /
                          ``session_cost_budget`` /
                          ``daily_token_budget`` / ``daily_cost_budget``)
                          so ``cheetahclaws daemon status`` can confirm
                          the serve-mode defaults are in effect.  Also
                          surfaces the running runner / bridge counts
                          for quick triage.
