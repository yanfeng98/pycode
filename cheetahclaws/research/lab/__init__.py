"""research/lab — multi-agent research lab.

Topic-in, paper-out: a directed-graph state machine that drives a
collaboration of agents (PI, Questioner, Surveyor, Designer, Writer,
Reviewer × 3, Lay Reader) through reseach-question framing, literature
review, outline drafting, section drafting, and reviewer-author
iteration until convergence or budget exhaustion.

Public surface (what callers should import):

  from cheetahclaws.research.lab import (
      LabRun, LabState, Stage, RoleAssignment,
      orchestrator, storage, verifier, output,
  )

The :class:`LabRun` orchestration is the only thing slash commands and
the daemon care about; everything else is internal scaffolding.

This is "engine v0":
  * No experiment execution yet (Phase 2)
  * No LaTeX/PDF rendering yet (Phase 2)
  * No web UI / multi-tenant (Phase 3)
  * No GPU pool (Phase 4)
