"""Source registry. Each source module exposes:
    search(query: str, limit: int, config: dict | None = None,
           time_range: "TimeRange | None" = None) -> list[Result]

`time_range` is best-effort: sources translate it to their native date
filter (arXiv `submittedDate:[...]`, HN `numericFilters=created_at_i>...`,
GitHub `pushed:>...`, etc.). Sources that can't honor it should return
results anyway — the ranker's recency weighting still biases output.

Sources raise on hard errors; the aggregator catches and reports them as
SourceStatus(ok=False). Sources may also skip themselves by raising
SourceSkipped (e.g. missing API key), which is reported as skipped
rather than failed.

Sources are tiered:
    TIER_FREE      — zero-config, always queried unless disabled
    TIER_OPTIONAL  — requires an API key; silently skipped without it

Domain assignment decides which sources run for a given domain filter:
    academic → arxiv, semantic_scholar, openalex
    tech     → hackernews, github, stackoverflow
    finance  → polymarket, sec_edgar
    news     → google_news
    social   → reddit, hackernews
    web      → tavily, brave  (+ google_news as a free fallback)
