"""
monitor/scheduler.py — Background scheduler for subscription monitoring.

Runs subscriptions on their configured schedule in a daemon thread.
Each subscription is checked against its schedule; if due, it fetches,
summarizes, and delivers via configured channels.

Schedule values:
  "30m"    — every 30 minutes
  "1h"     — every hour
  "6h"     — every 6 hours
  "12h"    — every 12 hours
  "daily"  — once per day (24h)
  "weekly" — once per week
