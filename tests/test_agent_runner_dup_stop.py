"""Tests for autonomous-agent stagnation detection in agent_runner.py.

Regression target: research_assistant template ran 1500+ iterations on
qwen2.5-72b producing the *byte-identical* "task complete, no more papers"
summary every time, burning ~6,000 API calls of pure waste. The fix adds a
generic per-summary repetition counter that stops the iteration loop when
the same summary appears N times in a row (default N=3).
