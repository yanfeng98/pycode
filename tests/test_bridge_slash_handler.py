"""Tests for cheetahclaws._make_bridge_slash_handler.

Issue #84 follow-up: in headless deployments (Docker, --web), bridges'
slash-command path silently dropped /<cmd> messages because
session_ctx.handle_slash was only wired in the interactive REPL.
The fix extracts the handler into a module-level factory used by both
the REPL and the headless bootstrap.

These tests pin the factory's contract so future changes to either
call site can't reintroduce the regression.
