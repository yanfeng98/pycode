"""cc_kernel.orchestrator — multi-step LLM workflows on the kernel.

A thin layer above ``cc_kernel.runner.llm`` that chains N
single-turn calls into higher-level patterns. Currently ships:

  DialogueOrchestrator     multi-turn conversation (RFC 0020)

Future RFCs will add:
  - Tool-using orchestrator (with permission routing)
  - DAG / step-graph orchestrator
  - Fan-out / aggregator
