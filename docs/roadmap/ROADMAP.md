# PyCode Roadmap

> **PyCode is evolving from a Python-native AI assistant into a local-first, multi-model Agent OS for autonomous coding, research workflows, and reproducible agent infrastructure.**

This document outlines the long-term direction, near-term milestones, and contribution priorities for the PyCode community.

---

## 1. Vision

PyCode aims to become a **Python-native Agent OS / Agent Runtime** for researchers, developers, and advanced users who want to build, run, inspect, control, and reproduce autonomous agents across different models and environments.

Instead of being only a coding assistant or a Claude Code reimplementation, PyCode should provide the infrastructure layer for agentic workflows:

- unified model runtime
- safe tool execution
- memory and context management
- long-horizon workflow scheduling
- checkpoint, resume, rollback, and replay
- observability and trace inspection
- skill/plugin ecosystem
- local-first and multi-model experimentation

In product language, this is an **Agent OS**.  
In systems language, this is a **durable agent runtime infrastructure layer**.

---

## 2. Core Positioning

### What PyCode is

PyCode is:

- **Python-native**: easy to read, modify, extend, and research.
- **Local-first**: supports local models, local tools, local files, and local workflows.
- **Multi-model**: supports proprietary and open models through unified interfaces.
- **Hackable**: users can modify the agent loop, tools, memory, skills, and workflow logic.
- **Reproducible**: agent runs should be traceable, comparable, replayable, and debuggable.
- **Safety-aware**: tool execution, file editing, shell commands, and network access should be governed by explicit permissions.

### What PyCode is not

PyCode should not primarily be:

- only a Claude Code clone
- only a chatbot
- only a trading bot
- only a personal assistant
- only a collection of unrelated demos
- a closed, model-specific agent product

The project should focus on **developer and research agent infrastructure** first.

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

PyCode should follow these principles:

1. **Runtime before app**  
   Build stable primitives for running agents before adding many user-facing demos.

2. **Workflows before prompts**  
   Useful agents need durable workflows, task graphs, checkpoints, tools, tests, and recovery mechanisms.

3. **Local-first by default**  
   Users should be able to run PyCode with local models, local files, and local tools whenever possible.

4. **Multi-model by design**  
   The same workflow should be runnable with Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, Zhipu, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

5. **Safety is infrastructure**  
   Permission control, sandboxing, audit logs, and secret redaction should be core runtime features, not optional add-ons.

6. **Everything should be inspectable**  
   Agent traces, tool calls, file diffs, command logs, cost, latency, context snapshots, and memory changes should be visible.

7. **Research-friendly engineering**  
   PyCode should make it easy to benchmark agents, compare models, reproduce results, and study failure modes.

---

## 4. Agent OS Primitives

PyCode should expose a set of OS-like primitives for agentic systems.

| Traditional OS Concept | PyCode Agent OS Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Process | Agent instance |
| Thread | Sub-agent / worker |
| File system | Workspace and artifact store |
| Memory | Short-term context, long-term memory, task state |
| Scheduler | Task planner and workflow executor |
| System call | Tool call / MCP call |
| Permission | Tool permission, sandbox policy, approval gate |
| IPC | Agent-to-agent communication |
| Shell | CLI, REPL, web UI, remote bridge |
| Logs | Trace, audit log, replay record |
| Package manager | Skill/plugin registry |

These primitives should guide the architecture and roadmap.

---

## 5. Architecture Roadmap

PyCode should evolve around six infrastructure layers.

---

### Layer 1: Unified Model Runtime

Goal: provide a consistent runtime interface for different LLM providers and local models.

Supported targets should include:

- Anthropic Claude
- OpenAI GPT models
- Google Gemini
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Kimi
- Zhipu
- MiniMax
- Ollama
- vLLM
- LM Studio
- any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Key features:

- streaming response normalization
- tool-call normalization
- provider-specific error handling
- retry and fallback
- model routing
- cost tracking
- latency tracking
- context length tracking
- model capability registry
- local model configuration templates

Example commands:

```bash
cheetah run task.yaml --model claude
cheetah run task.yaml --model qwen-vllm
cheetah run task.yaml --model deepseek
cheetah compare runs/ --models claude,gpt,qwen-vllm
```

Priority:

- [ ] Define a stable `ModelRuntime` interface.
- [ ] Add provider capability metadata.
- [ ] Add model routing and fallback.
- [ ] Add token, cost, latency, and context usage logging.
- [ ] Add reproducible model configuration files.

---

### Layer 2: Safe Tool Runtime

Goal: make tool execution powerful, controllable, observable, and safe.

Core tools:

- file read/write/edit
- bash/shell
- git
- Python execution
- notebook execution
- web/search/browser tools
- LaTeX tools
- repo inspection
- diagnostics
- MCP tools
- custom Python tools

Runtime requirements:

- typed tool schema
- tool permission levels
- command allowlist/blocklist
- approval-before-write
- approval-before-bash
- read-only mode
- sandbox mode
- network-disabled mode
- timeout and resource limits
- secret redaction
- tool failure recovery
- audit logs
- rollback for file edits

Suggested permission modes:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `read-only` | Agent can inspect files but cannot modify or execute risky commands. |
| `approve-edits` | Agent must ask before modifying files. |
| `approve-bash` | Agent must ask before running shell commands. |
| `workspace-write` | Agent can edit files inside the workspace. |
| `sandboxed` | Agent runs commands only inside a controlled sandbox. |
| `full-auto` | Agent can act autonomously under configured policy. |

Priority:

- [ ] Add `SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] Add tool permission policy config.
- [ ] Add dangerous command detection.
- [ ] Add secret redaction.
- [ ] Add file edit rollback.
- [ ] Add per-tool audit logs.
- [ ] Add sandbox execution mode.

---

### Layer 3: Memory and Context OS

Goal: provide explicit, inspectable memory and context management.

Memory should not only mean chat history. PyCode should support multiple memory types:

| Memory Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Working memory | Current task state, active goals, open files, recent decisions. |
| Episodic memory | Past runs, traces, failures, successes, and user interactions. |
| Semantic memory | Project knowledge, repo structure, user preferences, documentation. |
| Procedural memory | Skills, debugging recipes, workflows, tool-use patterns. |
| Artifact memory | Generated files, patches, experiment outputs, logs, reports. |

Context construction should answer:

- Which files are relevant?
- Which memories are relevant?
- Which past traces are useful?
- What should be compressed?
- What should be excluded for privacy or safety?
- What should be pinned into context?
- What should be retrieved only when needed?

Priority:

- [ ] Define memory interfaces.
- [ ] Add task-local working memory.
- [ ] Add persistent project memory.
- [ ] Add run trace memory.
- [ ] Add context snapshot export.
- [ ] Add memory diff viewer.
- [ ] Add privacy-aware context filtering.

---

### Layer 4: Durable Workflow Scheduler

Goal: support long-running, recoverable, multi-step agent workflows.

The runtime should support:

- task graph
- dependency graph
- plan/execute loop
- parallel workers
- checkpoints
- resume
- pause
- cancel
- retry
- fork
- rollback
- human approval gates
- scheduled or remote-triggered execution

Example workflow:

```text
plan -> inspect repo -> edit code -> run tests -> diagnose failures -> fix -> summarize diff -> create PR
```

Example commands:

```bash
cheetah task create "fix failing pytest"
cheetah task status
cheetah task pause
cheetah task resume
cheetah task fork
cheetah task replay
```

Priority:

- [ ] Define task graph format.
- [ ] Add checkpoint and resume for task runs.
- [ ] Add retry policy.
- [ ] Add task fork/replay.
- [ ] Add parallel worker execution.
- [ ] Add human approval nodes.
- [ ] Add long-running autonomous mode with safety constraints.

---

### Layer 5: Observability, Trace, and Replay

Goal: make every agent run inspectable and debuggable.

PyCode should provide a trace system that records:

- model used
- prompts and responses
- tool calls
- tool results
- shell commands
- file diffs
- errors and retries
- cost
- latency
- token usage
- context snapshots
- memory changes
- checkpoints
- final artifacts

Core features:

- terminal trace summary
- HTML trace report
- web trace viewer
- run comparison

cheetah trace export runs/2026-04-25-001 --format html
cheetah trace compare run_a run_b
cheetah replay run_a --from checkpoint_3
```

Priority:

- [ ] Define trace event schema.
- [ ] Log all model/tool/file/shell events.
- [ ] Add run summary.
- [ ] Add HTML trace export.
- [ ] Add run comparison.
- [ ] Add replay from checkpoint.

---

### Layer 6: Skill and Plugin Ecosystem

Goal: let users package reusable workflows, tools, prompts, and policies.

A PyCode skill should include:

- instructions
- tool requirements
- workflow steps
- examples
- tests
- permission requirements

Example skill packs:

- `coding`
- `repo-debugging`
- `github-issue-resolver`
- `research`
- `paper-reading`
- `latex-writing`
- `benchmarking`
- `vllm`
