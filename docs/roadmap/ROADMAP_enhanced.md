## 1. Vision

PyCode aims to become a **Python-native Agent OS / Agent Runtime** for researchers, developers, engineering teams, and advanced users who want to build, run, inspect, control, and reproduce autonomous agents across different models and environments.

In product language, PyCode is an **Agent OS**.

In systems language, PyCode is a **durable agent runtime infrastructure layer** that manages:

- models
- tools
- memory
- context
- workflows
- permissions
- traces
- checkpoints
- artifacts
- human approvals
- evaluations
- integrations

PyCode should not only answer prompts.  
It should help users complete real engineering and research tasks safely, reproducibly, and transparently.

---

## 2. Core Positioning

### One-line positioning

> **PyCode is a Python-native, local-first Agent OS for secure, reproducible, multi-model autonomous workflows.**

### Open-source positioning

> **A hackable agent runtime for researchers and advanced developers to build, study, benchmark, and customize autonomous agents.**

### Industrial product positioning

> **A secure agent runtime for engineering and research automation, with enterprise deployment, workflow templates, human approval, audit logs, and multi-model execution.**

### What PyCode is

PyCode is:

- **Python-native**: easy to read, modify, extend, debug, and research.
- **Local-first**: supports local files, local tools, local models, and private deployments.
- **Multi-model**: supports proprietary and open models through unified interfaces.
- **Hackable**: users can modify the agent loop, tools, memory, skills, and workflow logic.
- **Workflow-oriented**: focuses on completing real tasks, not only chatting.
- **Reproducible**: agent runs should be traceable, comparable, replayable, and debuggable.
- **Safety-aware**: tool execution, file editing, shell commands, and network access should be governed by explicit permissions.
- **Industrializable**: should support deployment, integrations, audit, governance, and reliability metrics.

### What PyCode is not

PyCode should not primarily be:

- only a Claude Code clone
- only a chatbot
- only a trading bot
- only a personal assistant
- only a collection of unrelated demos
- a closed, model-specific agent product
- a generic agent framework with no opinionated workflows
- a toy system that cannot be audited, recovered, or deployed

---

## 3. Who We Serve

PyCode should be useful for both open-source users and future industrial customers.

### Primary open-source users

| User | Need |
|---|---|
| AI researchers | Study agent behavior, memory, tools, safety, multi-model performance, and long-horizon workflows. |
| ML engineers | Run local/proprietary models on coding, debugging, evaluation, and experiment workflows. |
| Advanced developers | Automate repo tasks, CI failures, code changes, documentation, and PR preparation. |
| Open-source model community | Test whether local models can perform Claude-Code-style autonomous workflows. |
| AI safety researchers | Inspect, constrain, evaluate, and red-team autonomous agent behavior. |

### Primary industrial users

| User | Need |
|---|---|
| Engineering teams | Reduce repetitive debugging, CI investigation, code migration, documentation, and PR work. |
| Research teams | Automate paper reading, experiment setup, log analysis, result tables, and reports. |
| AI infrastructure teams | Compare models, deploy local agent runtimes, and evaluate agent reliability. |
| Platform teams | Provide governed agent infrastructure to internal users. |
| Security and compliance teams | Control tool permissions, audit actions, enforce policies, and prevent unsafe execution. |
| Team leads and managers | Understand agent ROI, reliability, failure modes, and human intervention rate. |

---

## 4. User Problems We Aim to Solve

PyCode should be guided by real user problems, not only infrastructure ambitions.

| User | Pain Point | PyCode Solution | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| Developer | CI failures take too long to investigate. | Agent inspects logs, identifies likely cause, edits code, runs tests, and proposes a fix. | Reduced time-to-fix; test pass rate. |
| Developer | Small repo issues consume repetitive engineering time. | Agent resolves GitHub/GitLab issues with traceable plans, diffs, tests, and PR summaries. | Issues resolved per week; human approval rate. |
| Engineering team | Code migrations are tedious and error-prone. | Agent performs scoped refactors, updates call sites, runs tests, and summarizes risk. | Migration completion rate; rollback rate. |
| Researcher | Experiments require repetitive setup and result formatting. | Agent creates configs, runs scripts, parses logs, generates tables, and writes summaries. | Faster experiment iteration; reproducible reports. |
| AI researcher | Hard to compare agentic ability across models. | Same workflow runs across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek, Ollama, vLLM, and other endpoints. | Model comparison report; benchmark success rate. |
| Platform team | Agents are hard to govern safely. | Permission policies, sandboxing, approval gates, audit logs, and rollback. | Unsafe action rate; policy violation rate. |
| Security team | Agent actions are hard to explain after failure. | Full trace, tool-call timeline, file diffs, approval records, and replay. | Incident review time; audit completeness. |
| Team lead | Unclear whether agents create business value. | ROI dashboard with time saved, cost per task, success rate, failure rate, and human intervention rate. | Cost saved per task; automation ROI. |

---

## 5. Product Principles

PyCode should follow these principles.

### 5.1 Runtime before app

Build stable primitives for running agents before adding many demos.

The project should avoid becoming a collection of disconnected assistants.  
Every major feature should strengthen the runtime.

### 5.2 Workflows before prompts

Useful agents need durable workflows, task graphs, checkpoints, tools, tests, recovery mechanisms, and human approval gates.

The main unit of value should be a completed task, not a long chat.

### 5.3 Local-first by default

Users should be able to run PyCode with local models, local files, and local tools whenever possible.

This matters for:

- privacy
- cost control
- enterprise deployment
- research reproducibility
- offline or air-gapped environments
- open-source model evaluation

### 5.4 Multi-model by design

The same workflow should be runnable with:

- Claude
- GPT
- Gemini
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Kimi
- Zhipu
- MiniMax
- Ollama
- vLLM
- LM Studio
- any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

PyCode should make it easy to compare models under the same workflow.

### 5.5 Safety is infrastructure

Permission control, sandboxing, audit logs, and secret redaction should be core runtime features.

Safety should not be an optional enterprise add-on.

### 5.6 Everything should be inspectable

Agent traces, tool calls, file diffs, command logs, cost, latency, context snapshots, and memory changes should be visible.

Users should be able to answer:

- What did the agent see?
- What did the agent decide?
- What tool did the agent call?
- What file did the agent change?
- What command did the agent run?
- Who approved it?
- Why did it fail?
- Can we replay or roll back?

### 5.7 Product value before feature count

Industrial users care about solved problems, reliability, security, and return on investment.

PyCode should prioritize a few high-value workflows over many shallow demos.

### 5.8 Human-in-the-loop first, full autonomy later

For real users, especially in industrial settings, the first useful product is often:

```text
agent drafts -> human approves -> agent executes -> human reviews -> agent learns
```

Full autonomy should be introduced only when permissions, rollback, audit, and reliability are mature.

---

## 6. Agent OS Primitives

PyCode should expose a set of OS-like primitives for agentic systems.

| Traditional OS Concept | PyCode Agent OS Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Process | Agent instance |
| Thread | Sub-agent / worker |
| File system | Workspace and artifact store |
| Memory | Short-term context, long-term memory, task state |
| Scheduler | Task planner and workflow executor |
| System call | Tool call / MCP call |
| Permission | Tool permission, sandbox policy, approval gate |
| IPC | Agent-to-agent communication |
| Shell | CLI, REPL, web UI, remote bridge |
| Logs | Trace, audit log, replay record |
| Package manager | Skill/plugin registry |
| Service manager | Long-running task manager |
| User account | Workspace identity / team identity |
| Access control | RBAC, policy, approval workflow |

These primitives should guide the architecture and implementation.

---

## 7. Technical Architecture Roadmap

PyCode should evolve around six infrastructure layers.

---

### Layer 1: Unified Model Runtime

Goal: provide a consistent runtime interface for different LLM providers and local models.

Supported targets should include:

- Anthropic Claude
- OpenAI GPT models
- Google Gemini
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Kimi
- Zhipu
- MiniMax
- Ollama

- retry and fallback
- model routing
- cost tracking
- latency tracking
- context length tracking
- model capability registry
- local model configuration templates
- OpenAI-compatible endpoint support
- per-model safety and tool-use compatibility notes

Example commands:

```bash
cheetah run task.yaml --model claude
cheetah run task.yaml --model qwen-vllm
cheetah run task.yaml --model deepseek
cheetah compare runs/ --models claude,gpt,qwen-vllm
```

### Layer 3: Memory and Context OS

Goal: provide explicit, inspectable memory and context management.

Memory should not only mean chat history. PyCode should support multiple memory types:

| Procedural memory | Skills, debugging recipes, workflows, tool-use patterns. |
| Artifact memory | Generated files, patches, experiment outputs, logs, reports. |
| Team memory | Shared project-level knowledge for labs or engineering teams. |

Context construction should answer:

- Which files are relevant?
- Which memories are relevant?
- Which past traces are useful?
- What should be compressed?
- What should be excluded for privacy or safety?
- What should be pinned into context?
- What should be retrieved only when needed?
