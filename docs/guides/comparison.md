# Comparison: CheetahClaws vs Claude Code & OpenClaw

The full positioning analysis. The [README](../../README.md) carries a condensed
"at a glance" version of each comparison; this page keeps the complete detail.

## Why CheetahClaws

Claude Code is a powerful, production-grade AI coding assistant — but its source code is a compiled, 12 MB TypeScript/Node.js bundle (~1,300 files, ~283K lines). It is tightly coupled to the Anthropic API, hard to modify, and impossible to run against a local or alternative model.

**CheetahClaws** reimplements the same core loop in ~40K lines of readable Python, keeping everything you need and dropping what you don't.

### At a glance

| Dimension | Claude Code (TypeScript) | CheetahClaws (Python) |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Language | TypeScript + React/Ink | Python 3.8+ |
| Source files | ~1,332 TS/TSX files | ~85 Python files |
| Lines of code | ~283K | ~40K |
| Built-in tools | 44+ | 27 |
| Slash commands | 88 | 36 |
| Voice input | Proprietary Anthropic WebSocket (OAuth required) | Local Whisper / OpenAI API — works offline, no subscription |
| Model providers | Anthropic only | 8+ (Anthropic · OpenAI · Gemini · Kimi · Qwen · DeepSeek · MiniMax · Ollama · …) |
| Local models | No | Yes — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Build step required | Yes (Bun + esbuild) | No — run directly with `python cheetahclaws.py` (or install to use `cheetahclaws`) |
| Runtime extensibility | Closed (compile-time) | Open — `register_tool()` at runtime, Markdown skills, git plugins |
| Task dependency graph | No | Yes — `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges in `task/` package |

### Where Claude Code wins

- **UI quality** — React/Ink component tree with streaming rendering, fine-grained diff visualization, and dialog systems.
- **Tool breadth** — 44 tools including `RemoteTrigger`, `EnterWorktree`, and more UI-integrated tools.
- **Enterprise features** — MDM-managed config, team permission sync, OAuth, keychain storage, GrowthBook feature flags.
- **AI-driven memory extraction** — `extractMemories` service proactively extracts knowledge from conversations without explicit tool calls.
- **Production reliability** — single distributable `cli.js`, comprehensive test coverage, version-locked releases.

### Where CheetahClaws wins

- **Multi-provider** — switch between Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, or a local Llama model with `--model` or `/model` — no recompile needed.
- **Local model support** — run entirely offline with Ollama, LM Studio, or any vLLM-hosted model.
- **Readable source** — the full agent loop is 174 lines (`agent.py`). Any Python developer can read, fork, and extend it in minutes.
- **Zero build** — `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're running. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Dynamic extensibility** — register new tools at runtime with `register_tool(ToolDef(...))`, install skill packs from git URLs, or wire in any MCP server.
- **Task dependency graph** — `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` support `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges for structured multi-step planning (not available in Claude Code).
- **Two-layer context compression** — rule-based snip + AI summarization, configurable via `preserve_last_n_turns`.
- **Notebook editing** — `NotebookEdit` directly manipulates `.ipynb` JSON (replace/insert/delete cells) with no kernel required.
- **Diagnostics without LSP server** — `GetDiagnostics` chains pyright → mypy → flake8 → py_compile for Python and tsc/shellcheck for other languages, with zero configuration.
- **Offline voice input** — `/voice` records via `sounddevice`/`arecord`/SoX, transcribes with local `faster-whisper` (no API key, no subscription), and auto-submits. Keyterms from your git branch and project files boost coding-term accuracy.
- **Cloud session sync** — `/cloudsave` backs up conversations to private GitHub Gists with zero extra dependencies; restore any past session on any machine with `/cloudsave load <id>`.
- **SSJ Developer Mode** — `/ssj` opens a persistent power menu with 10 workflow shortcuts: Brainstorm → TODO → Worker pipeline, expert debate, code review, README generation, commit helper, and more. Stays open between actions; supports `/command` passthrough.
- **Telegram Bot Bridge** — `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` turns cheetahclaws into a Telegram bot: receive user messages, run the model, and send back responses — all from your phone. Slash commands pass through, and a typing indicator keeps the chat feeling live.
- **WeChat Bridge** — `/wechat login` authenticates with WeChat via a QR code scan (the same iLink Bot API used by the official WeixinClawBot / `openclaw-weixin` plugin), then starts a long-poll bridge. Slash command passthrough, interactive menu routing, typing indicator, session auto-recovery, and per-peer `context_token` management all work out of the box.
- **Slack Bridge** — `/slack <xoxb-token> <channel_id>` connects cheetahclaws to a Slack channel using the Slack Web API (stdlib only — no `slack_sdk` required). Polls `conversations.history` every 2 seconds; replies update an in-place "Thinking…" placeholder. Slash command passthrough, interactive menu routing, and auto-start on launch.
- **QQ Bridge** — `/qq <appid>` (with `$QQ_SECRET`) connects cheetahclaws to QQ **groups** (@-mention) and **C2C** private chats via the official `qq-botpy` WebSocket SDK (`pip install cheetahclaws[qq]`). Streams replies as new messages (QQ can't edit), per-target job queues, slash command passthrough, image input, and permission prompts scoped to the originating chat. Auto-starts on launch when configured.
- **Worker command** — `/worker` auto-implements pending tasks from `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`, marks each one done after completion, and supports task selection by number (e.g. `1,4,6`).
- **Force quit** — 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers immediate `os._exit(1)`, unblocking any frozen I/O.
- **Proactive background monitoring** — `/proactive 5m` activates a sentinel daemon that wakes the agent automatically after a period of inactivity, enabling continuous monitoring loops, scheduled checks, or trading bots without user prompts.
- **Rich Live streaming rendering** — When `rich` is installed, responses stream as live-updating Markdown in place (no duplicate raw text), with clean tool-call interleaving.
- **Native Ollama reasoning** — Local reasoning models (deepseek-r1, qwen3, gemma4) stream their `<think>` tokens directly to the terminal via `ThinkingChunk` events; enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking`.
- **Native Ollama vision** — `/image [prompt]` captures the clipboard and sends it to local vision models (llava, gemma4, llama3.2-vision) via Ollama's native image API. No cloud required.
- **Built-in Web UI** — `--web` launches a production-ready browser interface: multi-user accounts (bcrypt + JWT), SQLite-backed session history that survives restarts, rich Chat UI at `/chat` with streaming messages, tool cards, permission approval, sidebar session CRUD + search + markdown export, light/dark/system theme, settings panel with per-provider API keys. Full xterm.js PTY terminal at `/` keeps 100% CLI parity. Ops endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) + structured JSON logs + 21 pytest end-to-end tests. Nine tiny vanilla-JS modules under `web/static/js/` — no Node.js, no React, no build step. `cheetahclaws --web` auto-picks a free port if 8080 is taken.
- **Reliable multi-line paste** — Bracketed Paste Mode (`ESC[?2004h`) collects any pasted text — code blocks, multi-paragraph prompts, long diffs — as a single turn with zero latency and no blank-line artifacts.
- **Rich Tab completion** — Tab after `/` shows all commands with one-line descriptions and subcommand hints; subcommand Tab-complete works for `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/tasks`, `/cloudsave`, and more.
- **Checkpoint & rewind** — `/checkpoint` lists all auto-snapshots of conversation + file state; `/checkpoint <id>` rewinds both files and history to any earlier point in the session.
- **Plan mode** — `/plan <desc>` (or the `EnterPlanMode` tool) puts Claude into a structured read-only analysis phase; only the plan file is writable. Claude writes a detailed plan, then `/plan done` restores full write permissions for implementation.

## Key design differences

**Agent loop** — CheetahClaws uses a Python generator that `yield`s typed events (`TextChunk`, `ToolStart`, `ToolEnd`, `TurnDone`). The entire loop is visible in one file, making it easy to add hooks, custom renderers, or logging.

**Tool registration** — every tool is a `ToolDef(name, schema, func, read_only, concurrent_safe)` dataclass. Any module can call `register_tool()` at import time; MCP servers, plugins, and skills all use the same mechanism.

**Context compression**

| | Claude Code | CheetahClaws |
|-|-------------|-----------------|
| Trigger | Exact token count | `len / 3.5` estimate, fires at 70 % |
| Layer 1 | — | Snip: truncate old tool outputs (no API cost) |
| Layer 2 | AI summarization | AI summarization of older turns |
| Control | System-managed | `preserve_last_n_turns` parameter |

**Memory** — Claude Code's `extractMemories` service has the model proactively surface facts. CheetahClaws's `memory/` package is tool-driven: the model calls `MemorySave` explicitly, which is more predictable and auditable. Each memory now carries `confidence`, `source`, `last_used_at`, and `conflict_group` metadata; search re-ranks by confidence × recency; and `/memory consolidate` offers a manual consolidation pass without silently modifying memories in the background.

## Who should use CheetahClaws

- Developers who want to **use a local or non-Anthropic model** as their coding assistant.
- Researchers studying **how agentic coding assistants work** — the entire system fits in one screen.
- Teams who need a **hackable baseline** to add proprietary tools, custom permission policies, or specialised agent types.
- Anyone who wants Claude Code-style productivity **without a Node.js build chain**.
