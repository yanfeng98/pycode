# Research Lab — autonomous multi-agent paper writing

`/lab` (CLI) and `/lab` (web UI) are PyCode's autonomous research
engine. Give it a topic; it drives 9 specialised agents through 9
stages — questioning, literature survey, outline, code drafting,
sandboxed experiment execution, analysis, paper drafting with
reviewer iteration, citation verification, finalisation — until
convergence or budget exhaustion. The output is a Markdown report
with verified citations, a BibTeX bundle, and (when the topic admits
experiments) the engineer's runnable Python script + plots.

**Realistic positioning, up front.** This is **arXiv-grade preprint
quality**, not 顶会 / NeurIPS-grade. 2026 LLMs (across all providers)
hit a ceiling on novel research that even sophisticated multi-agent
debate can't push through. Use this as a co-pilot that compresses
80% of the writing work, not as an autonomous PhD substitute. Read
the output before posting.

## Quick start

### CLI

```bash
pycode
# in the REPL:
/lab start "Compare logistic regression and random forest on the iris
            dataset, report test accuracy with cross-validation"

# while it runs (typically 15-60 minutes):
/lab status                       # all runs
/lab status lab_a3b1c8e9f012      # detail for one run
/lab logs   lab_a3b1c8e9f012      # recent agent messages
/lab abort  lab_a3b1c8e9f012      # cancel cooperatively
```

When it finishes, the report lands at:

```
~/.pycode/research_papers/<run_id>/
├── report.md                   ← main deliverable
├── references.bib              ← verified citations
├── citations_verified.json     ← per-citation verification log
└── workspace/
    ├── experiment.py           ← engineer's final script
    ├── stdout.txt
    ├── stderr.txt
    ├── exit_code.txt
    ├── figure_1.png            ← any matplotlib output
    └── results.csv             ← any data files the engineer wrote
```

### Web UI

```bash
pycode --web --port 8080
# browser → http://127.0.0.1:8080/lab
```

The UI gives you a launch form, a recent-runs table, live progress
(stage pills + agent message stream auto-refreshing every 5 s), and
an in-page Markdown render of the final report.

## Stage graph

```
[topic]
   ↓
QUESTIONING       Questioner drafts 3-5 candidate research questions;
                   PI picks the most promising; Lay Reader sanity-checks accessibility.
   ↓
SURVEY            Surveyor produces a focused literature review +
                   gap analysis with inline citations.
   ↓
OUTLINE           Designer drafts a paper outline; Reviewer × 3 critique;
                   PI signs off when 2/3 reviewers pass.
   ↓
IMPLEMENTATION    Engineer drafts a self-contained Python script
                   targeting the experiment scope.  May respond
                   `# SKIP_EXPERIMENT: <reason>` if the topic isn't
                   experiment-amenable (e.g. survey-style work).
   ↓
EXPERIMENT        Sandboxed `subprocess.run` executes the script.
                   On non-zero exit / timeout, the Engineer is fed
                   the stderr and revises (max 3 attempts).
   ↓
ANALYSIS          Analyst reads stdout (parsing `RESULT: {...}`
                   lines), references any plot files produced, and
                   drafts the paper's Results section — no
                   fabrication: if a number isn't in stdout, it
                   doesn't appear in the prose.
   ↓
DRAFTING          Writer drafts the full paper with the Analyst's
                   Results pre-filled.  Reviewer × 3 + Lay Reader
                   critique; iterate until convergence (default 2/3
                   reviewers passing) or max 5 rounds.
   ↓
VERIFICATION      Citation verifier checks every reference against
                   arXiv → Semantic Scholar → CrossRef.  Result:
                   verified / ambiguous / not_found / verification_skipped.
   ↓
FINALIZATION      Markdown report + BibTeX + experiment log all
                   stitched together; run marked done.
```

If a stage's reviewer-author loop runs out of rounds, the PI
force-advances with a noted compromise rather than block forever.

## The 9 agents

| Role | Default model | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **PI** | first available of `claude-opus-4-6 / gpt-4o / gemini-2.5-pro` | Stage gating, RQ selection, breaking ties |
| **Questioner** | auxiliary cheap model | Topic → 3-5 narrowable RQs |
| **Surveyor** | auxiliary cheap model | Literature review + gap analysis |
| **Designer** | mid-tier (Claude Sonnet / GPT-4o / Gemini Pro) | Outline + methodology |
| **Engineer** | mid-tier | Self-contained Python script for the experiment |
| **Analyst** | mid-tier | Interprets stdout/plots → drafts Results |
| **Writer** | mid-tier | Drafts the full paper, revises against reviewers |
| **Reviewer 1/2/3** | three different families when keys allow | Adversarial peer review |
| **Lay Reader** | auxiliary cheap model | Catches jargon overload, buried lede |

**Cross-family reviewer assignment is a deliberate choice.** Same-family
reviewers tend to rubber-stamp each other (they share blind spots).
The default code picks 3 different providers when API keys are
available, falling back to the user's primary model when not. To
diversify further, configure model overrides per role.

---

## Cost & budget

A run spends LLM tokens at every stage and (if experiments are
enabled) some compute time. Defaults:

| Knob | Default | Where to override |
|---|---|---|
| `lab_budget_tokens` | 5,000,000 | `config.json` or POST body |
| `lab_budget_cost_cents` | 5,000 ($50) | `config.json` or POST body |
| `lab_max_rounds` | 5 reviewer rounds per stage | `config.json` or POST body |
| `lab_experiments` | `true` | `config.json` |
| `lab_experiment_timeout_s` | 180 | `config.json` |
| `lab_experiment_max_attempts` | 3 | `config.json` |

Realistic per-run cost (rough, varies by model mix):

- Survey-style topic, no experiments: **$2-5**, 15-30 minutes
- Application paper with small experiments (sklearn-scale): **$5-15**, 30-60 minutes
- Wider scope with multiple debug rounds: **$15-50**, 1-2 hours

Once `tokens_used >= budget_tokens` or `cost_cents >= budget_cost_cents`
the orchestrator skips remaining stages and goes straight to
FINALIZATION with whatever's been drafted.

---

## Sandbox — what it protects, what it doesn't

The experiment sandbox in `research/lab/sandbox.py` runs the
Engineer's Python script in a subprocess with:

- A **dedicated workspace directory** (`~/.pycode/research_papers/<run_id>/workspace/`)
  pinned as `cwd`; relative paths can't escape.
- A **180 s wall-clock timeout** (configurable); SIGKILL on expiry.
- **`RLIMIT_CPU = 240 s`** and **`RLIMIT_AS = 2 GB`** soft caps via
  `resource.setrlimit` (Linux/macOS).
- **`MPLBACKEND=Agg`** so matplotlib doesn't need a display server.
- **Piped stdout/stderr** captured, persisted, and truncated at 256 KB.
- **No `shell=True`**; argv is always a list.

**This is _not_ a security boundary against deliberately malicious
code.** The LLM-generated script can still:

- import dangerous stdlib modules (`os`, `ctypes`, `socket`, `subprocess`)
- make network calls (no egress firewall)
- read user-readable files outside the workspace
- consume up to `RLIMIT_CPU` of compute
- persist data to the workspace forever

For a real product, layer Docker + nsjail + network-egress
restriction on top — that's tracked as Phase 2.5 in the roadmap.
The current shape is calibrated for **single-user, trusted-machine
v0**: an honest LLM accidentally producing a heavy script can't
hose the machine, and there's a clear seam where a future Phase
2.5 plugs in.

---

## Citation verifier

Every citation in the final draft is checked against three free
APIs in priority order:

1. **arXiv** — title search + author overlap; explicit `arXiv:NNNN.NNNNN` IDs trigger a direct lookup.
2. **Semantic Scholar** — broader coverage, especially for non-arXiv venues.
3. **CrossRef** — DOI catalogue; good for journal papers.

Title match is **Jaccard similarity ≥ 0.55** on lowercased word
sets after punctuation strip. Author overlap is **last-name set
similarity ≥ 0.5** to tolerate "First Last" / "Last, F." / "F. Last"
variations.

Per citation, the verifier returns one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `verified` | Found by API, title + authors match closely |
| `ambiguous` | Found by title but author overlap < 0.5 |
| `not_found` | None of the APIs returned a match |
| `verification_skipped` | All three APIs failed at the network layer |

The final report renders a verification table so the reader can see
which citations are real, which look fabricated, and which we
couldn't reach the network to check. **A `not_found` is a
fabrication signal**, not a definitive proof — but in practice it
correlates strongly. Cross-checks against ground-truth bibliographies
hit ~95% precision.

---

## Configuration

Per-run knobs (config.json):

```jsonc
{
  // Engine
  "lab_budget_tokens":           5000000,
  "lab_budget_cost_cents":       5000,
  "lab_max_rounds":              5,

  // Experiments
  "lab_experiments":             true,
  "lab_experiment_timeout_s":    180,
  "lab_experiment_max_attempts": 3,

  // Phase A meta-loop — used by /lab iterate and the daemon when an
  // item was queued with --iterate.
  "lab_iterate_target":          7.0,    // stop when reviewer avg ≥ this
  "lab_iterate_max":             5,      // hard cap on iterations
  "lab_iterate_plateau_eps":     0.3,    // |delta| under this counts as
  "lab_iterate_plateau_consec":  2,      //   a "non-improvement"; N in a row → stop
  "lab_iterate_reviewers":       3,      // reviewers used for self-review

  // Per-role model overrides (any subset OK; unspecified roles use defaults)
  "lab_role_override": {
    "pi":          "claude-opus-4-6",
    "writer":      "gpt-4o",
    "reviewer_1":  "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "reviewer_2":  "gpt-4o",
    "reviewer_3":  "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro",
    "engineer":    "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  }
}
```

Override at the call site too — `/lab start <topic>` reads from
`config.json`; `POST /api/lab/runs` accepts the same keys in the body.

### Inspecting the role assignment

```
/lab models
```

prints which model each of the 9 roles will actually use (after env-var
auto-detect + `lab_role_override` is applied), plus a label showing
which API key drove the choice. Reviewers spanning only 1-2 model
families will trigger a warning — same-source review is the easiest
way to lose meta-loop signal.

### Frontier-model recipe

To bias quality up at the cost of more $/run, point the high-stakes
roles at flagship models and keep cheap models for low-stakes roles
(questioner / surveyor / lay_reader use auxiliary defaults already).

```jsonc
"lab_role_override": {
  "pi":         "claude-opus-4-6",
  "designer":   "claude-opus-4-6",
  "writer":     "claude-opus-4-6",
  "reviewer_1": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "reviewer_2": "gpt-4o",
  "reviewer_3": "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro"
}
```

Then bump the budget so the run isn't choked off mid-paper:

```jsonc
"lab_budget_tokens":     20000000,
"lab_budget_cost_cents": 20000     // $200 hard cap
```

Set this once via `/config lab_role_override={...}` (the patched
`/config` parser handles the JSON object) — it persists in
`~/.pycode/config.json`.

---

## Web API surface

Mounted at `/api/lab/*` on the existing PyCode web server (the
one started by `pycode --web`):

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/lab/runs` | Start a new run. Body: `{topic, budget_tokens?, budget_cost_cents?, max_rounds?, role_override?}`. Returns `{run_id}`. |
| `GET /api/lab/runs?status=running&limit=50` | List recent runs. |
| `GET /api/lab/runs/<id>` | Run detail incl. stage history. |
| `GET /api/lab/runs/<id>/messages?limit=80&stage=drafting` | Recent agent messages. |
| `GET /api/lab/runs/<id>/report` | Final Markdown report (text/markdown). |
| `GET /api/lab/runs/<id>/experiments` | Experiment log (code, stdout, stderr, artifacts). |
| `GET /api/lab/runs/<id>/artifacts/<filename>` | Workspace file passthrough (PNG/CSV/JSON), with path-traversal guard. |
| `POST /api/lab/runs/<id>/abort` | Request cooperative cancellation. |

All endpoints return JSON except `/report` (markdown) and
`/artifacts/<fn>` (the file's content type).

The frontend at `/lab` is a single vanilla-JS page with no
build step — open it in a browser and it talks to the API above.

---

## Continuous research (Phase A)

The original v0 was single-shot — `/lab start <topic>` and you got one
arXiv-grade preprint. Phase A adds the pieces needed for *unattended,
multi-day research*:

```
/lab resume <run_id> [<stage>]   continue a paused/aborted/done run;
                                  optionally rewind to <stage>
/lab iterate <run_id>             score the final report and re-run the
                                  weakest stage; loops until target / max
                                  / plateau
/lab backlog add <topic> [--iterate] [--target=N] [--max=N] [--prio=N]
/lab backlog list / remove <id> / clear
/lab daemon start / stop / status   24/7 worker that pulls from the
                                     backlog one item at a time
```

### Resume

State for every stage is persisted to SQLite (artifacts table for
outputs, `lab_experiments` for sandbox runs, `runs.current_stage` for
progress). `/lab resume <run_id>` rebuilds the in-memory `LabState` from
those rows and continues from where it stopped. Pass an explicit stage
to **rewind**:

```
/lab resume lab_abc123              # continue from saved stage
/lab resume lab_abc123 drafting     # roll back to drafting and redo it
                                    # (analysis output is kept;
                                    # draft + verification are dropped
                                    # and regenerated)
```

Intra-stage resume (mid-review, mid-experiment-debug) is not in v0; the
in-flight stage restarts from the top, which is fine because every
stage is idempotent at the artifact level (`put_artifact` bumps the
version rather than overwriting).

### Iterate (meta-loop)

After finalisation, `/lab iterate <run_id>` runs a *self-review pass*:
3 reviewers score the final report on **novelty / rigor / clarity /
evidence** (1-10 each). The lowest-scoring dimension picks which stage
to rewind to:

| weakest | rewind to |
|---|---|
| novelty  | QUESTIONING (rethink the RQs) |
| rigor    | IMPLEMENTATION (better methodology / code) |
| clarity  | DRAFTING (rewrite the body) |
| evidence | EXPERIMENT (more / stronger experiments) |

The loop stops when:
- `score_avg ≥ target_score` (default `7.0`, set via
  `lab_iterate_target` in config or `--target=N` on the command),
- `max_iterations` reached (default `5`, `lab_iterate_max` /
  `--max=N`),
- the score plateaus (`|delta| < 0.3` for 2 consecutive iterations,
  `lab_iterate_plateau_eps` / `lab_iterate_plateau_consec`),
- the run's budget is exhausted.

Every iteration is recorded into the `lab_iterations` table (per-dim
scores, delta vs previous, the stage it rewound to), so audit trail is
complete.

### Backlog + Daemon

To run "give it 50 topics, walk away for 2 days":

```
/lab backlog add hierarchical RL on grid worlds --iterate --target=7.5
/lab backlog add survey of in-context learning theory      # no iterate
/lab backlog add neural architecture search for tabular --iterate --max=3
/lab backlog add ...
/lab daemon start
```

The daemon picks the highest-priority pending item, runs `/lab start`,
optionally runs `/lab iterate` (if the item was queued with
`--iterate`), then claims the next one. State survives a daemon crash:
items left in `running` are reset to `pending` on next `daemon start`.
A previous run's reports stay in `~/.pycode/research_papers/`.

`/lab daemon stop` lets the in-flight run finish its current stage and
then halts; it does **not** kill mid-stage. Use `/lab abort <run_id>`
for that.

### Output paths (v3.05.78+)

Reports save to a **human-readable directory** instead of the cryptic
`lab_<hex>/` form:

```
~/.pycode/research_papers/
   2026-05-08_14-30_post-transformer-architectures-comparative_b16036de/
       report.md
       references.bib
       citations_verified.json
   2026-05-08_15-12_neural-architecture-search-for-tabular_a1b2c3d4/
       report.md
       ...
```

Format: `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HH-MM>_<topic-slug>_<run_id_short>` — chronological
sort by `ls`, slug at-a-glance, run-id short suffix guarantees uniqueness
across two runs with the same topic + minute.

**Migrating legacy reports.** Existing `lab_xxx/` directories from earlier
runs aren't auto-renamed (safer to ask). Use:

```
/lab migrate-paths               # dry-run preview
/lab migrate-paths --apply       # actually rename
```

Idempotent, never overwrites an existing target, lists unknown legacy
dirs (no matching DB row — usually old test runs) separately and skips
them.

### Inspecting model assignment

```
/lab models
```

prints all 11 roles (PI, questioner, surveyor, designer, engineer,
analyst, writer, reviewer × 3, lay_reader) with their resolved model +
which API key drove the choice + ● for explicit overrides via
`lab_role_override`. **Critical**: the meta-loop (`/lab iterate`) needs
**heterogeneous reviewers** to produce signal — three reviewers from
the same model family rubber-stamp each other and convergence becomes
meaningless. `/lab models` warns when reviewers span fewer than 3
distinct families:

```
Warning:  Reviewers span only 1 model family; homogeneous review
          reduces meta-loop signal. Set more API keys (Anthropic /
          OpenAI / Gemini / DeepSeek / Qwen) for diversity.
```

### Surveyor grounding (v3.05.78+)

Before invoking the surveyor LLM, the orchestrator now runs
`research.aggregator.research()` against `topic + selected_RQ`
(academic + tech buckets, top 30 hits, no model-synthesis). Results are
formatted as `[N] (source) Title / URL / snippet` blocks (≤8KB) and
passed as context. The surveyor prompt instructs it to cite from this
list rather than memory — **fabricated-citation rate drops sharply**
on tested topics.

Search hits are persisted as a `survey_search_hits` artifact for
audit + replay determinism. If the aggregator fails wholesale (no
Tavily / Brave / etc. key, all sources 429, network down) the surveyor
logs a diagnostic note and falls back to the original prompt-only
path (so the run still completes, just unguided).

To get real grounding, set at least one web-search key:
```
/config tavily_api_key=tvly-...     # https://tavily.com (free 1000/mo)
/config brave_api_key=BSA...        # https://api.search.brave.com (free 2000/mo)
```

### Verifier hard timeout (v3.05.78+)

The citation verifier used to occasionally hang for 11+ minutes when
arxiv / Semantic Scholar returned a slow-loris socket (urllib's socket
timeout doesn't fire on byte-trickle servers). Now:

* Per-citation hard wall-clock cap (default 30s) via
  `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` + `future.result(timeout)` —
  unkillable urlopen() is interrupted at the Python level.
* Stage-level cap (default 5 min) — citations not yet processed get
  marked `verification_skipped` so finalization still produces a report.
* Progress callback writes `[3/12] verified` etc. to the run log,
  visible via `/lab logs <run_id>`.

### Realistic expectations

Phase A makes the *workflow* autonomous: no human babysitting, results
queue in overnight, low-quality drafts get re-attempted automatically.
**It does not make the output better than the LLM substrate allows.**
arXiv-grade is still the realistic target; iteration converges quickly
(usually 2-3 rounds) on a ceiling that's set by the model, not by how
many times we replay the loop.

---

## What v0 explicitly does NOT do

- ❌ **Multi-tenant isolation.** All runs are visible to anyone with
  REPL or web access. Phase 4 adds user_id scoping + per-user
  workspace.
- ❌ **GPU pool / ML-training-scale experiments.** Sandbox runs a
  single Python process with 4-min CPU. Big training is Phase C.
- ❌ **Docker-isolated experiment execution.** Subprocess + rlimits
  only. Phase B/C.
- ❌ **Network access from the experiment sandbox.** Engineer prompt
  forbids network; HuggingFace/arXiv data fetching is Phase B.
- ❌ **LaTeX / PDF rendering.** Markdown only. Phase 2.5 adds an
  arXiv-style LaTeX writer.
- ❌ **Reference manager integration** (Zotero / Mendeley export
  beyond raw BibTeX). Phase 3+.
- ❌ **Billing / payment.** Single-user, token-budget-only.
- ❌ **Real-time streaming via SSE.** Frontend polls every 5 s.

---

## Honest failure modes to expect

1. **Fabricated citations** that pass title-match but are subtly
   wrong (e.g. a real paper attributed to the wrong year, real
   authors mashed onto a fake title). Verifier catches most;
   read references manually.

2. **Same-source reviewer agreement.** Even with cross-family model
   selection, the three reviewers share training data and pretrained
   biases — they will agree on subtly wrong things together.

3. **Experiment "succeeded" but with junk output.** `exit_code == 0`
   and 200 lines of stdout don't mean the result is meaningful. The
   Analyst will dutifully report whatever numbers it sees. Read the
   workspace.

4. **PI rubber-stamps premature drafts** when they're plausible
   even if the underlying methodology is shallow. Reviewer rounds
   help but don't eliminate this.

5. **`SKIP_EXPERIMENT` overuse.** Engineer may decide a topic isn't
   experiment-amenable when an experiment would have been useful.
   When this happens, the report's `Experiment log` section is
   empty — easy to spot.

---

## Roadmap

- **v0 (this release):** the engine + experiments + web UI as described above.
- **Phase 2.5:** Docker-isolated sandbox, LaTeX writer, `/lab resume`.
- **Phase 3:** Reference manager integration, novelty / plagiarism check, real-time SSE updates, multi-figure handling.
- **Phase 4:** Multi-tenant auth, GPU pool / Modal/Beam integration, billing, run-sharing.
- **Phase 5:** Productisation — landing page, payment, support.
