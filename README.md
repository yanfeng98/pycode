## 🔥🔥🔥 News (Pacific Time)

 
- May 8, 2026: **F-2/F-3 follow-ups + CI unblock (`feature/fix-f2`).** Main has been red since `9c01237d` (the trading-agent #99 merge) because `tests/test_packaging.py::test_required_module_imports[modular.trading.ml]` (issue #97 regression test) caught that `modular/trading/ml/features.py` and `modular/trading/portfolio.py` import numpy at module top while numpy is in the `[trading]` extra — `pip install .` shipped a broken wheel and #100 / #101 inherited the red. Two-commit fix on top of #101: (a) `fix(ci)` — drop the dead numpy import from `features.py`; defer numpy to inside `stacker.py:train()` / `predict_proba()` past their early-return paths; gate `portfolio.py`'s numpy behind `try/except`; add `pytest.mark.skipif` on the optimizer / managed-portfolio / ML-training / factor-scan tests so lean-install CI skips them cleanly. Verified: clean venv with only `[web,autosuggest]` (the exact CI install) **1075 passed, 11 skipped**; with full extras **1086 passed**, no regressions. (b) `fix(daemon)` — five F-2/F-3 follow-ups: move `monitor.scheduler.start(...)` past the listener bind in `cc_daemon/cli.py:cmd_serve` (so a misconfigured fetch/deliver can't fail before the daemon is reachable); add `_foreign_daemon_running()` step-aside check at every scheduler loop tick to close the race where REPL `/monitor start` fires before the daemon writes its discovery file (both schedulers would otherwise race on `last_run_at`); flip `cc_daemon/schema.py` to `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` (safe under WAL, **8× faster `EventBus.publish`** — 305 μs/event → 39 μs/event, important for streaming agent output); clarify in `jobs.py` / `monitor/store.py` / `docs/architecture.md` that the JSON→SQLite migration is **one-way** (PR #101's wording implied a fallback read path that doesn't exist); update `docs/RFC/0002-daemon-foundation-roadmap.md` F-2/F-3 status from OPEN → MERGED. Branch: `feature/fix-f2`.

- May 8, 2026 (**v3.05.78**): **Research lab Phase A — autonomous multi-day research; WeChat smart-reply + `/draft` semi-auto reply; reliability + UX hardening across the lab pipeline.** Two big surfaces shipped together: (a) the research lab is no longer single-shot — `/lab resume <run_id> [<stage>]` reconstructs `LabState` from SQLite to continue or rewind a run; `/lab iterate <run_id>` runs a 3-reviewer self-review on the final report (novelty / rigor / clarity / evidence, 1-10), routes the lowest-scoring dimension to the corresponding stage (novelty→QUESTIONING, rigor→IMPLEMENTATION, clarity→DRAFTING, evidence→EXPERIMENT), rewinds + re-runs, loops until `target_score` / `max_iterations` / plateau / budget; `/lab backlog add <topic> --iterate --target=N --max=N --prio=N` queues many topics, `/lab daemon start` runs them 24/7 in a single-worker loop with crash-recovery (`reset_running_backlog` unsticks stale rows on next start); `/lab models` prints the effective per-role model + which API key drove each pick + warns when reviewers span <N families (homogeneous review = no meta-loop signal); `/lab migrate-paths [--apply]` renames legacy `lab_xxx/` output dirs to the human-readable `<date>_<time>_<topic-slug>_<run_id_short>` form (e.g. `2026-05-08_14-30_post-transformer-architectures-survey_b16036de/`). (b) **WeChat smart-reply panel** — when a whitelisted contact sends an inbound message, an auxiliary cheap model drafts 3 candidate replies and pushes them as a panel to your `filehelper` (文件传输助手); reply with `1`/`2`/`3`/`AA 1` to send, freeform text to customise, `x` to skip, `q` for queue. SQLite-persisted at `~/.cheetahclaws/wx_smart_reply.db` (in-memory fallback on init failure); contacts JSON at `~/.cheetahclaws/wx_contacts.json` is mtime-hot-reloaded; **bot-owner self-uid is auto-recorded on first inbound and excluded from smart-reply unconditionally**, so your own messages always reach the agent regardless of whitelist contents. (c) **`/draft <message>` slash command** — semi-automatic reply suggestion path for cases where the bot can't intercept the inbound directly (bot account ≠ user main account on iLink ClawBot). 3 candidates drafted via the auxiliary model, optionally tone-conditioned via `@<contact_uid_or_label>` against `wx_contacts.json`; when invoked from a bridge channel (WeChat / Telegram / Slack), candidates are also echoed back to the originating uid + stashed in `bridges.draft_cache` so a digit-only reply (`1`/`2`/`3`) consumes the chosen text one-shot, no agent invocation, no smart-reply panel triggered. **Reliability hardening on top of #88's MCP work**: `research/http.py` now uses 429-aware backoff (10/30/60/120s vs 0.5/1/2/4s for 5xx) and honours `Retry-After` headers (capped at 180s); the lab surveyor stage grounds in real `research.aggregator.research()` hits before invoking the LLM (top-30 academic+tech results passed as context, persisted as `survey_search_hits` artifact for replay) — fabricated-citation rate drops sharply on tested topics; `_dedupe_self_repeat()` trims cheap-model degenerate sampling (`text == text+text`) before storage so reviewer prompts don't see doubled inputs; `_extract_numbered` dedupes by content (questioner emitting `1..5\n1..5` keeps 5, not 10); the citation verifier now has a per-citation 30s `concurrent.futures` hard wall-clock (kills slow-loris sockets that urllib's socket-timeout ignores) + a 5-min stage-level cap with progress callbacks surfaced to `/lab logs` (the 11-min hang we saw in the field is gone). **REPL ergonomics**: `/lab daemon start` and `/lab start` now print the eventual report.md path up front + live-stream stage transitions to the terminal as they happen; `/lab status <run_id>` shows both new + legacy paths so the user can find old reports too; `/config` parses JSON-style values (lists, dicts, signed numbers, quoted strings) — `/config wechat_smart_reply_whitelist=["wxid_..."]` no longer silently saved as a literal string; leading whitespace before `/` is now stripped before slash-dispatch (so a paste with a stray space still hits the dispatcher, not the agent). Tests: **884 passing** (842 unit/integration + 22 e2e), zero regressions; ~80 new pytest cases covering iteration scoring, state reconstruction, backlog atomicity, verifier hard-timeout, slug edge cases, dedupe patterns, self-uid bypass.**
- May 7, 2026 (**v3.05.77**): **MCP HTTP/SSE transport + OAuth 2.0 PKCE, `.env` loader, `ANTHROPIC_ENDPOINT` corporate-proxy override, AskUserQuestion UI polish (#88, #89)** — `cc_mcp/client.py` now speaks Streamable HTTP (POST → `text/event-stream` reply) in addition to stdio and pure SSE, with the `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header servers like sap-jira require to stop 406-ing. **OAuth 2.0**: new `cc_mcp/oauth.py` implements the full MCP Authorization spec — RFC 9728 resource-server discovery → RFC 8414 AS metadata → RFC 7591 dynamic client registration → Authorization Code + PKCE (S256) flow with browser redirect → automatic refresh-token rotation. Tokens persist atomically to `~/.cheetahclaws/mcp_oauth.json` at mode `0600` with the parent directory locked to `0700`. The redirect-URI port is picked once and reused for both registration and the local callback server, the OAuth scope is sourced from the AS's advertised `scopes_supported` (preferring `mcp` if listed, otherwise the first one, otherwise omitted entirely so servers without an `mcp` scope no longer reject with `invalid_scope`), and `_ensure_oauth()` is guarded by a dedicated lock so concurrent 401-retries can't race on the httpx client rebuild. **REPL**: `/mcp add <name> --transport http <url>` and `/mcp add <name> --transport sse <url>` for one-line HTTP server registration; explicit `/mcp list` subcommand with full-width tool descriptions wrapped at 72 cols. **Server name sanitization**: hyphenated names like `github-tools` now resolve correctly through the `mcp__server__tool` qualified-name path. **`.env` loader**: `_load_env()` runs at the very top of `cheetahclaws.py` before any other import reads `os.environ`, so `.env` keys are visible to every module without losing existing-shell-var precedence (`os.environ.setdefault`). MCP HTTP `headers` values are passed through `os.path.expandvars`, so `"Authorization": "Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"` works out of the box. **`ANTHROPIC_ENDPOINT`** env var (also reachable via `.env`) overrides the persisted `anthropic_endpoint` config and is used by both the streaming Anthropic client (`providers.py` passes `base_url=...` to `anthropic.Anthropic`) and the connectivity probes in `/doctor` / setup wizard, letting corporate proxies swap `api.anthropic.com` cleanly. **UI**: `AskUserQuestion` is auto-approved alongside `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` (it's an interactive tool by definition, a permission prompt was redundant), the spinner and result line are suppressed in `print_tool_start/end`, the question text is rendered through `clr()` with Markdown stripped (`**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `*italic*`), and option indices/descriptions are colorized. The REPL prompt now prints a full-width `─` rule via `os.get_terminal_size()` (80-char fallback) before each input, matching Claude Code's visual rhythm.**
- May 5, 2026: **Telegram bridge file round-trip + cross-channel pickable permission prompts (#84) — `bridges/telegram.py` previously only had `_tg_send` (text via `sendMessage`), so when the model claimed it had "sent a file" it was just text and the `[approve][reject]` text in permission prompts only *looked* like buttons. Added `_tg_send_document` (multipart/form-data upload, 49 MB cap with explicit oversize/empty/missing/network/API-rejection error reporting), an inbound `document` handler that saves uploads to `/workspace` (or `tempfile.gettempdir()` outside Docker) with sanitized filenames and a path-aware prompt, a `!sendfile <path>` user command for explicit on-demand sends, and an auto-send hook in `_bg_runner` that mails any file written by the `Write` tool — FIFO-paired with the in-flight `file_path`, skipped on `Error:` / `Denied:` results, and de-duplicated per turn so parallel writes don't double-mail. **Cross-channel permission UX**: `ask_input_interactive(options=[(label, value), …])` now renders an interactive picker on every bridge — Telegram gets a real `inline_keyboard` (`callback_data="cc:<prompt_id>:<value>"`, `_handle_callback_query` does auth + stale-prompt-id drop + `answerCallbackQuery` + `editMessageText "✓ Selected: y"`), Slack and WeChat get a numbered menu in the message body (reply with digit / canonical letter / label word — all resolve via `_resolve_choice`), terminal prints the same numbered menu before the input cursor; `ask_permission_interactive` passes `[(✅ Approve, y), (❌ Reject, n), (✅✅ Accept all, a)]`. Backward-compatible: every existing `ask_input_interactive` call site (no `options=`) keeps free-text behavior. 49 new pytest cases (`tests/test_telegram_bridge.py` + `tests/test_options_menu.py`) — no real network calls. **718 passed**, zero regressions on the 669 pre-existing. `--accept-all` was a red herring; the bridge simply lacked the upload code path.**
- May 3, 2026: **Research Lab — autonomous multi-agent paper writing with sandboxed experiments + web UI.** New `/lab start <topic>` (CLI) and `/lab` page (web) drive 9 specialised agents — PI / Questioner / Surveyor / Designer / Engineer / Analyst / Writer / Reviewer × 3 / Lay Reader — through 9 stages: questioning → literature survey → outline → code drafting → sandboxed Python execution → analysis → paper drafting with reviewer iteration → citation verification (arXiv / Semantic Scholar / CrossRef) → finalisation. Reviewer pool defaults to 3 *different* provider families to reduce same-source rubber-stamping. Real experiments via subprocess sandbox with timeout / `RLIMIT_CPU` / `RLIMIT_AS` (v0 isolation; Docker is Phase 2.5). Output is a Markdown report with verified citations + BibTeX bundle + the engineer's runnable script and any plots. **Targets arXiv-grade preprint quality, not top conferences** — the LLM substrate caps quality, not orchestration. Single-run cost typically $2-15. Branch: `feature/research-lab`. Full guide: [`docs/guides/research-lab.md`](docs/guides/research-lab.md).
- May 2, 2026: **Daemon foundation lands (#80) — `cheetahclaws serve` + `cheetahclaws daemon {status, stop, logs, rotate-token}`** are real. F-1 of the [9-PR daemon roadmap](docs/RFC/0002-daemon-foundation-roadmap.md) merged via PR #80, on top of a re-landed spike (PR #81) that the RFC 0001 contract code lives in. End users see no new feature yet — F-1 ships the headless daemon + control surface, but no service runs inside it. `/healthz` `/readyz` `/metrics` are now auth-gated by default per RFC 0001 §3 (opt out via `--unauthenticated-metrics`). Plus a polish follow-up (#82) closing four nits: `daemon` verbs honor `--token-path` via a `token_path` field on `daemon.json`; `--help` dispatch returns 0; serve-mode prints flush immediately under `&` redirection.
- May 2, 2026: **Docker chat UI assets 404 follow-up (#73) — `web/server.py` now resolves `_WEB_DIR` via `importlib.resources.files("web")` instead of `Path(__file__).parent`, so static files are found whether the package is installed editable or non-editable. The dotfile guard in the static-file branch now only inspects path segments inside `_WEB_DIR`, so installs sitting under `.venv/`, `.local/`, etc. no longer 404 every asset. `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` for `web` widened to `static/**/*` so non-editable wheels reliably ship the full `web/static/` subtree. Plus a new `docs/guides/docker.md` "Custom Dockerfile pitfalls" section covering the editable-install requirement and the most common 404 root cause for users rolling their own image.**
- Apr 30, 2026: **Docker / home-server support (#73) — `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, host Ollama via `host.docker.internal`, workspace bind-mount for Samba sharing. `--web` mode now auto-starts configured Telegram / WeChat / Slack bridges in the same process so a single container delivers browser UI + phone bridge. Plus two terminal/agent fixes: `AskUserQuestion` no longer deadlocks the terminal (#69) — synchronous render+read instead of a queue/event the agent thread can't drain. `messages_to_openai` emits `content: ""` instead of `null` for tool-only assistant turns so Ollama's OpenAI-compat endpoint stops 400-ing with `invalid message content type: <nil>`; 400 / `BadRequestError` reclassified as a non-retryable `INVALID_REQUEST` so a malformed body no longer trips the circuit breaker (#71).**
- Apr 24, 2026: **Support Deepseek V4 models, multi-model prompt adaptation — single shared `default.md` baseline + tiny per-family overlays (Anthropic XML tags · Gemini 3 explicit Agentic Mode · OpenAI o-series no-narration). Routing is by model family, not provider/runtime — same Qwen prompt whether served via DashScope, Ollama, or OpenRouter. Overlays must cite a vendor prompting guide (≤ 20 lines, enforced by tests). DeepSeek v4 thinking-mode protocol (`reasoning_content` round-trip + `thinking: ON` by default). fix(setup-wizard): tolerate api_key_env=None for ollama/lmstudio (#59)**
- Apr 20, 2026 (**v3.05.76**): **Research pipeline — 20 sources across academia/tech/finance/social/web + cross-platform attention heat table, publication trend sparkline, notable-citer analysis, entity extraction, multi-query expansion, side-by-side compare, saved reports, weekly trend tracking via `/monitor`, one-click `/ssj` wizard. Also including Chinese platforms: Zhihu (知乎) · Bilibili (B站) · Weibo (微博) · Rednote (小红书).**
- Apr 18, 2026 (**v3.05.75**): **External plugin discovery via `CHEETAHCLAWS_PLUGIN_PATH` + safer dependency management; tool-history integrity fix for OpenAI-compatible providers (DeepSeek et al.); end-to-end prompt-cache token tracking across providers with full checkpoint round-trip**
- Apr 16, 2026 (**v3.05.74**): **Web UI production hardening — persistence, multi-user auth, ops endpoints, JS module split, pytest suite**

## Why CheetahClaws

Claude Code is a powerful, production-grade AI coding assistant — but its source code is a compiled, 12 MB TypeScript/Node.js bundle (~1,300 files, ~283K lines). It is tightly coupled to the Anthropic API, hard to modify, and impossible to run against a local or alternative model.

**CheetahClaws** reimplements the same core loop in ~40K lines of readable Python, keeping everything you need and dropping what you don't. See here for more detailed analysis (CheetahClaws v3.03), [English version](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/comparison_claude_code_vs_nano_v3.03_en.md) and [Chinese version](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/comparison_claude_code_vs_nano_v3.03_cn.md)

### At a glance

| Dimension | Claude Code (TypeScript) | CheetahClaws (Python) |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Language | TypeScript + React/Ink | Python 3.8+ |
| Source files | ~1,332 TS/TSX files | ~85 Python files |
| Lines of code | ~283K | ~40K |
| Built-in tools | 44+ | 27 |
| Slash commands | 88 | 36 |
| Voice input | Proprietary Anthropic WebSocket (OAuth required) | Local Whisper / OpenAI API — works offline, no subscription |
| Model providers | Anthropic only | 8+ (Anthropic · OpenAI · Gemini · Kimi · Qwen · DeepSeek · MiniMax · Ollama · …) |
| Local models | No | Yes — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Build step required | Yes (Bun + esbuild) | No — run directly with `python cheetahclaws.py` (or install to use `cheetahclaws`) |
| Runtime extensibility | Closed (compile-time) | Open — `register_tool()` at runtime, Markdown skills, git plugins |
| Task dependency graph | No | Yes — `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges in `task/` package |

### Where Claude Code wins

- **UI quality** — React/Ink component tree with streaming rendering, fine-grained diff visualization, and dialog systems.
- **Tool breadth** — 44 tools including `RemoteTrigger`, `EnterWorktree`, and more UI-integrated tools.
- **Enterprise features** — MDM-managed config, team permission sync, OAuth, keychain storage, GrowthBook feature flags.
- **AI-driven memory extraction** — `extractMemories` service proactively extracts knowledge from conversations without explicit tool calls.
- **Production reliability** — single distributable `cli.js`, comprehensive test coverage, version-locked releases.

### Where CheetahClaws wins

- **Multi-provider** — switch between Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, or a local Llama model with `--model` or `/model` — no recompile needed.
- **Local model support** — run entirely offline with Ollama, LM Studio, or any vLLM-hosted model.
- **Readable source** — the full agent loop is 174 lines (`agent.py`). Any Python developer can read, fork, and extend it in minutes.
- **Zero build** — `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're running. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Dynamic extensibility** — register new tools at runtime with `register_tool(ToolDef(...))`, install skill packs from git URLs, or wire in any MCP server.
- **Task dependency graph** — `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` support `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges for structured multi-step planning (not available in Claude Code).
- **Two-layer context compression** — rule-based snip + AI summarization, configurable via `preserve_last_n_turns`.
- **Notebook editing** — `NotebookEdit` directly manipulates `.ipynb` JSON (replace/insert/delete cells) with no kernel required.
- **Diagnostics without LSP server** — `GetDiagnostics` chains pyright → mypy → flake8 → py_compile for Python and tsc/shellcheck for other languages, with zero configuration.
- **Offline voice input** — `/voice` records via `sounddevice`/`arecord`/SoX, transcribes with local `faster-whisper` (no API key, no subscription), and auto-submits. Keyterms from your git branch and project files boost coding-term accuracy.
- **Cloud session sync** — `/cloudsave` backs up conversations to private GitHub Gists with zero extra dependencies; restore any past session on any machine with `/cloudsave load <id>`.
- **SSJ Developer Mode** — `/ssj` opens a persistent power menu with 10 workflow shortcuts: Brainstorm → TODO → Worker pipeline, expert debate, code review, README generation, commit helper, and more. Stays open between actions; supports `/command` passthrough.
- **Telegram Bot Bridge** — `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` turns cheetahclaws into a Telegram bot: receive user messages, run the model, and send back responses — all from your phone. Slash commands pass through, and a typing indicator keeps the chat feeling live.
- **WeChat Bridge** — `/wechat login` authenticates with WeChat via a QR code scan (the same iLink Bot API used by the official WeixinClawBot / `openclaw-weixin` plugin), then starts a long-poll bridge. Slash command passthrough, interactive menu routing, typing indicator, session auto-recovery, and per-peer `context_token` management all work out of the box.
- **Slack Bridge** — `/slack <xoxb-token> <channel_id>` connects cheetahclaws to a Slack channel using the Slack Web API (stdlib only — no `slack_sdk` required). Polls `conversations.history` every 2 seconds; replies update an in-place "Thinking…" placeholder. Slash command passthrough, interactive menu routing, and auto-start on launch.
- **Worker command** — `/worker` auto-implements pending tasks from `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`, marks each one done after completion, and supports task selection by number (e.g. `1,4,6`).
- **Force quit** — 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers immediate `os._exit(1)`, unblocking any frozen I/O.
- **Proactive background monitoring** — `/proactive 5m` activates a sentinel daemon that wakes the agent automatically after a period of inactivity, enabling continuous monitoring loops, scheduled checks, or trading bots without user prompts.
- **Rich Live streaming rendering** — When `rich` is installed, responses stream as live-updating Markdown in place (no duplicate raw text), with clean tool-call interleaving.
- **Native Ollama reasoning** — Local reasoning models (deepseek-r1, qwen3, gemma4) stream their `<think>` tokens directly to the terminal via `ThinkingChunk` events; enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking`.
- **Native Ollama vision** — `/image [prompt]` captures the clipboard and sends it to local vision models (llava, gemma4, llama3.2-vision) via Ollama's native image API. No cloud required.
- **Built-in Web UI** — `--web` launches a production-ready browser interface: multi-user accounts (bcrypt + JWT), SQLite-backed session history that survives restarts, rich Chat UI at `/chat` with streaming messages, tool cards, permission approval, sidebar session CRUD + search + markdown export, light/dark/system theme, settings panel with per-provider API keys. Full xterm.js PTY terminal at `/` keeps 100% CLI parity. Ops endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) + structured JSON logs + 21 pytest end-to-end tests. Nine tiny vanilla-JS modules under `web/static/js/` — no Node.js, no React, no build step. `cheetahclaws --web` auto-picks a free port if 8080 is taken.
- **Reliable multi-line paste** — Bracketed Paste Mode (`ESC[?2004h`) collects any pasted text — code blocks, multi-paragraph prompts, long diffs — as a single turn with zero latency and no blank-line artifacts.
- **Rich Tab completion** — Tab after `/` shows all commands with one-line descriptions and subcommand hints; subcommand Tab-complete works for `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/tasks`, `/cloudsave`, and more.
- **Checkpoint & rewind** — `/checkpoint` lists all auto-snapshots of conversation + file state; `/checkpoint <id>` rewinds both files and history to any earlier point in the session.
- **Plan mode** — `/plan <desc>` (or the `EnterPlanMode` tool) puts Claude into a structured read-only analysis phase; only the plan file is writable. Claude writes a detailed plan, then `/plan done` restores full write permissions for implementation.

## CheetahClaws vs OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is another popular open-source AI assistant built on TypeScript/Node.js. The two projects have **different primary goals** — here is how they compare.

### At a glance

| Dimension | OpenClaw (TypeScript) | CheetahClaws (Python) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Language | TypeScript + Node.js | Python 3.8+ |
| Source files | ~10,349 TS/JS files | ~85 Python files |
| Lines of code | ~245K | ~12K |
| Primary focus | Personal life assistant across messaging channels | AI **coding** assistant / developer tool |
| Architecture | Always-on Gateway daemon + companion apps | Zero-install terminal REPL |
| Messaging channels | 20+ (WhatsApp · Telegram · Slack · Discord · Signal · iMessage · Matrix · WeChat · …) | Terminal + Telegram bridge + WeChat bridge (iLink) + Slack bridge (Web API) |
| Model providers | Multiple (cloud-first) | 7+ including full local support (Ollama · vLLM · LM Studio · …) |
| Local / offline models | Limited | Full — Ollama, vLLM, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Voice | Wake word · PTT · Talk Mode (macOS/iOS/Android) | Offline Whisper STT (local, no API key) |
| Code editing tools | Browser control, Canvas workspace | Read · Write · Edit · Bash · Glob · Grep · NotebookEdit · GetDiagnostics |
| Build step required | Yes (`pnpm install` + daemon setup) | No — `pip install` and run |
| Mobile companion | macOS menu bar + iOS/Android apps | — |
| Live Canvas / UI | Yes (A2UI agent-driven visual workspace) | — |
| MCP support | — | Yes (stdio/SSE/HTTP) |
| Runtime extensibility | Skills platform (bundled/managed/workspace) | `register_tool()` at runtime, MCP, git plugins, Markdown skills |
| Hackability | Large codebase (245K lines), harder to modify | ~12K lines — full agent loop visible in one file |

### Where OpenClaw wins

- **Omni-channel inbox** — connects to 20+ messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Discord, Teams, Matrix, WeChat…); users interact from wherever they already are.
- **Always-on daemon** — Gateway runs as a background service (launchd/systemd); no terminal required for day-to-day use.
- **Mobile-first** — macOS menu bar, iOS Voice Wake / Talk Mode, Android camera/screen recording — feels like a native app, not a CLI tool.
- **Live Canvas** — agent-driven visual workspace rendered in the browser; supports A2UI push/eval/snapshot.
- **Browser automation** — dedicated Chrome/Chromium profile with snapshot, actions, and upload tools.
- **Production reliability** — versioned npm releases, comprehensive CI, onboarding wizard, `openclaw doctor` diagnostics.

### Where CheetahClaws wins

- **Coding toolset** — Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep/NotebookEdit/GetDiagnostics are purpose-built for software development; CheetahClaws understands diffs, file trees, and code structure.
- **True local model support** — full Ollama/vLLM/LM Studio integration with streaming, tool-calling, and vision — no cloud required.
- **8+ model providers** — switch between Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, and local models with a single `--model` flag.
- **Hackable in minutes** — 12K lines of readable Python; the entire agent loop is in `agent.py`; extend with `register_tool()` at runtime without rebuilding.
- **Zero setup** — `pip install cheetahclaws` and run `cheetahclaws`; no daemon, no pairing, no onboarding wizard.
- **MCP support** — connect any MCP server (stdio/SSE/HTTP); tools auto-registered.
- **SSJ Developer Mode** — `/ssj` power menu chains Brainstorm → TODO → Worker → Debate in a persistent interactive session; automates entire dev workflows.
- **Offline voice** — `/voice` transcribes locally with `faster-whisper`; no subscription, no OAuth, works without internet.
- **Session cloud sync** — `/cloudsave` backs up full conversations to private GitHub Gists with zero extra dependencies.

### When to choose which

| If you want… | Use |
|---|---|
| A personal assistant you can message on WhatsApp/Signal/Discord | **OpenClaw** |
| An AI coding assistant in your terminal | **CheetahClaws** |
| Full offline / local model support | **CheetahClaws** |
| A mobile-friendly always-on experience | **OpenClaw** |
| To read and modify the source in an afternoon | **CheetahClaws** |
| Browser automation and a visual Canvas | **OpenClaw** |
| Multi-provider LLM switching without rebuilding | **CheetahClaws** |

---

### Key design differences

**Agent loop** — CheetahClaws uses a Python generator that `yield`s typed events (`TextChunk`, `ToolStart`, `ToolEnd`, `TurnDone`). The entire loop is visible in one file, making it easy to add hooks, custom renderers, or logging.

**Tool registration** — every tool is a `ToolDef(name, schema, func, read_only, concurrent_safe)` dataclass. Any module can call `register_tool()` at import time; MCP servers, plugins, and skills all use the same mechanism.

**Context compression**

| | Claude Code | CheetahClaws |
|-|-------------|-----------------|
| Trigger | Exact token count | `len / 3.5` estimate, fires at 70 % |
| Layer 1 | — | Snip: truncate old tool outputs (no API cost) |
| Layer 2 | AI summarization | AI summarization of older turns |
| Control | System-managed | `preserve_last_n_turns` parameter |

**Memory** — Claude Code's `extractMemories` service has the model proactively surface facts. CheetahClaws's `memory/` package is tool-driven: the model calls `MemorySave` explicitly, which is more predictable and auditable. Each memory now carries `confidence`, `source`, `last_used_at`, and `conflict_group` metadata; search re-ranks by confidence × recency; and `/memory consolidate` offers a manual consolidation pass without silently modifying memories in the background.

### Who should use CheetahClaws

- Developers who want to **use a local or non-Anthropic model** as their coding assistant.
- Researchers studying **how agentic coding assistants work** — the entire system fits in one screen.
- Teams who need a **hackable baseline** to add proprietary tools, custom permission policies, or specialised agent types.
- Anyone who wants Claude Code-style productivity **without a Node.js build chain**.

| Console themes | `/theme` lists 15 curated palettes (default · dracula · nord · gruvbox · solarized · tokyo-night · catppuccin · matrix · synthwave · midnight · ocean · monokai · cheetah · mono · none); each row shows a live `info / ok / warn / err` swatch in the theme's own colors. `/theme <name>` applies and persists the choice — also drives Rich's Markdown code-block style. |
| Voice input | Record → transcribe → auto-submit. Backends: `sounddevice` / `arecord` / SoX + `faster-whisper` / `openai-whisper` / OpenAI API. Works fully offline. |
| Brainstorm | `/brainstorm [topic]` generates N expert personas suited to the topic (2–100, default 5, chosen interactively), runs an iterative debate, saves results to `brainstorm_outputs/`, and synthesizes a Master Plan + auto-generates `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`. |
| SSJ Developer Mode | `/ssj` opens a persistent interactive power menu with **15 shortcuts**: Brainstorm, TODO viewer, Worker, Expert Debate, Propose, Review, Readme, Commit, Scan, Promote, Video factory, TTS factory, Monitor, **Trading**, Agent. Stays open between actions; `/command` passthrough supported. |
| Trading agent v3.1 | **Automatic candidate discovery**: `/trading discover all` scans an S&P 100 universe and surfaces tickers from four orthogonal sources — SEC EDGAR Form 4 insider clusters, recent ≥10% earnings beats with post-print drift, momentum-quality factor intersection, leading sector ETFs' top holdings — then merges with a cross-source confluence bonus. `/trading rank` composite-ranks candidates by factor + discovery + calibration tilt. `/trading anomaly` flags unusual volume / price gaps / vol regime spikes. `/trading monitor scan --notify telegram slack wechat` runs anomaly + stop-loss + earnings + new-insider-filing detection and dispatches alerts to bridges. **Single-name analysis**: `/trading analyze <SYMBOL>` runs a multi-agent pipeline (Bull/Bear → Judge → Risk Panel → PM) with macro / earnings / insider / sentiment / trends / book context auto-injected. `/trading review` runs incremental HOLD/ADD/TRIM/EXIT debate on existing positions. **Autonomous mode**: `/trading manage start hundred 100` creates a virtual `$100` portfolio that the agent allocates + rebalances via mean-variance optimization (`step` / `report`). Persistent paper-trade tracker → `/trading calibration` answers "is the agent any good?" with hit-rate by confidence + t-stat vs zero. Hard risk verifier enforces position / sector / stop / earnings-blackout caps. `/trading walkforward` does honest OOS rolling-chunk backtesting. `/trading ml train` builds a LightGBM stacker. Broker abstraction: `PaperBroker` works out of the box, `IBKRBroker` stub for `pip install ib_insync` + IB Gateway. Supports US/HK/A-share stocks and 20+ cryptos. |
| Monitor | `/monitor` (no args → wizard) subscribes to AI-monitored topics on a schedule and pushes reports to Telegram/Slack/console. Topics: `ai_research` (arxiv), `stock_<TICKER>`, `crypto_<SYMBOL>`, `world_news` (Reuters/BBC/AP), `custom:<query>`. Schedules: 15m to weekly. Background scheduler daemon with `/monitor start/stop/status`. |
| Research (multi-source) | `/research <topic>` fans out to **20 sources** in parallel and synthesizes a brief with inline citations, a **cross-platform attention heat table**, **top-mentioned entities** (models / benchmarks / orgs / people), and a **12-month publication trend sparkline**: **arXiv · Semantic Scholar · OpenAlex · HuggingFace Papers · alphaXiv · Google Scholar · HackerNews · GitHub · Reddit · StackOverflow · Google News · Polymarket · SEC EDGAR · Tavily · Brave · Twitter/X · 知乎 Zhihu · B站 Bilibili · 微博 Weibo · 小红书 Xiaohongshu**. Supports `--range 30d\|6m\|1y\|…` / `--since YYYY-MM-DD` / `--until YYYY-MM-DD` — each source translates to its native date filter. `--citations` surfaces "Notable citing authors" with ≥10k total citations. `--expand` asks the model for 2-6 sibling subqueries and merges their results for broader coverage. `/research compare "A" vs "B" [vs "C"]` produces a side-by-side comparative brief with `[A-N]`/`[B-N]`/`[C-N]`-prefixed citations. Every run auto-saves to `~/.cheetahclaws/research_reports/`; `/reports list\|open\|delete\|path` to browse, `--save-as PATH` to export. **Weekly trend tracking**: `/subscribe research:<topic> weekly` (or `/ssj` → `17. Trend Track`) re-runs the whole pipeline automatically and pushes digests to Telegram / Slack / console. One-click wizard via `/ssj` → `16. Research` / `17. Trend Track` / `18. Reports`. 13/20 sources zero-config; 7 optional (Tavily · Brave · Twitter · Zhihu · Weibo · Xiaohongshu · Google Scholar). See [docs/guides/research.md](docs/guides/research.md). |
| Autonomous Agents | `/agent` (no args → wizard) launches autonomous background agent loops driven by Markdown task templates. 4 built-in templates: `research_assistant`, `auto_bug_fixer`, `paper_writer`, `auto_coder`. Iteration summaries pushed via bridge. Custom templates: drop a `.md` file into `~/.cheetahclaws/agent_templates/`. |
| Remote Control job queue | All three bridges (Telegram/Slack/WeChat) maintain a per-bridge FIFO job queue when the AI is busy. `!jobs` / `!j` — dashboard; `!job <id>` — detail; `!retry <id>` — re-run a failed job; `!cancel [id]` — stop current job. Tool step tracking with `on_tool_start`/`on_tool_end` hooks. Persistent log at `~/.cheetahclaws/jobs.json`. |
| Worker | `/worker [task#s]` reads `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`, implements each pending task with a dedicated model prompt, and marks it done (`- [x]`). Supports task selection (`/worker 1,4,6`), custom path (`--path`), and worker count limit (`--workers`). Detects and redirects accidental brainstorm `.md` paths. |
| Telegram bridge | `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` starts a bot bridge: receive messages from Telegram, run the model, and reply — all from your phone. Typing indicator, slash command passthrough (including interactive menus), and auto-start on launch if configured. |
| WeChat bridge | `/wechat login` authenticates via QR code scan (same as WeixinClawBot / openclaw-weixin plugin), then starts the iLink long-poll bridge. `context_token` echoed per peer, typing indicator, slash command passthrough, session expiry auto-recovery. Credentials saved for auto-start on next launch. |
| Slack bridge | `/slack <xoxb-token> <channel_id>` connects to a Slack channel via the Web API (no external packages). Polls `conversations.history` every 2 s; replies update an in-place "Thinking…" placeholder. Slash command passthrough, interactive menu routing, auth validation on start, auto-start on next launch. |
| Video factory | `/video [topic]` runs the full AI video pipeline: story generation (active model) → TTS narration (Edge/Gemini/ElevenLabs) → AI images (Gemini Web free or placeholders) → subtitle burn (Whisper) → FFmpeg assembly → final `.mp4`. 10 viral content niches, landscape or short format, zero-cost path available. |
| TTS factory | `/tts` interactive wizard: AI writes script (or paste your own) → synthesize to MP3 in any voice style (narrator, newsreader, storyteller, ASMR, motivational, documentary, children, podcast, meditation, custom). Engine auto-selects: Gemini TTS → ElevenLabs → Edge TTS (always-free). CJK text auto-switches to a matching voice. |
| Vision input | `/image` (or `/img`) captures the clipboard image and sends it to any vision-capable model — Ollama (`llava`, `gemma4`, `llama3.2-vision`) via native format, or cloud models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, …) via OpenAI `image_url` multipart format. Requires `pip install cheetahclaws[vision]`; Linux also needs `xclip`. |
| Tmux integration | 11 tmux tools for direct terminal control: create sessions/windows/panes, send commands, capture output. Auto-detected; zero impact if tmux is absent. Enables long-running tasks that outlive Bash tool timeouts. Cross-platform (tmux on Unix, psmux on Windows). |
| Shell escape | Type `!command` in the REPL to execute any shell command directly without AI involvement (`!git status`, `!ls`, `!python --version`). Output prints inline. |
| Proactive monitoring | `/proactive [duration]` starts a background sentinel daemon; agent wakes automatically after inactivity, enabling continuous monitoring loops without user prompts |
| Force quit | 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers `os._exit(1)` — kills the process immediately regardless of blocking I/O |
| Rich Live streaming | When `rich` is installed, responses render as live-updating Markdown in place. Auto-disabled in SSH sessions to prevent repeated output; override with `/config rich_live=false`. |
| Context injection | Auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`, git status, cwd, persistent memory |
| Session persistence | Autosave on exit to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` (per-day limit) + `history.json` (master, all sessions) + `session_latest.json` (/resume); sessions include `session_id` and `saved_at` metadata; `/load` grouped by date |
| Cloud sync | `/cloudsave` syncs sessions to private GitHub Gists; auto-sync on exit; load from cloud by Gist ID. No new dependencies (stdlib `urllib`). |
| Extended Thinking | Toggle on/off for Claude models; native `<think>` block streaming for local Ollama reasoning models (deepseek-r1, qwen3, gemma4) |
| Cost tracking | Token usage + estimated USD cost |
| Non-interactive mode | `--print` flag for scripting / CI |
| **Web UI** | `--web` opens the browser. Multi-user accounts (bcrypt + JWT), SQLite-persisted history, session CRUD + markdown export, light/dark/system theme, `/health` + `/metrics`, auto-picks a free port if 8080 is busy. `pip install 'cheetahclaws[web]'`. |

### Open-Source (Local via Ollama)

| Model | Size | Strengths | Pull Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llama3.3` | 70B | General purpose, strong reasoning | `ollama pull llama3.3` |
| `llama3.2` | 3B / 11B | Lightweight | `ollama pull llama3.2` |
| `qwen2.5-coder` | 7B / 32B | **Best for coding tasks** | `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder` |
| `qwen2.5` | 7B / 72B | Chinese & English | `ollama pull qwen2.5` |
| `deepseek-r1` | 7B–70B | Reasoning, math | `ollama pull deepseek-r1` |
| `deepseek-coder-v2` | 16B | Coding | `ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2` |

| `llama3.2-vision` | 11B | **Vision** — multimodal reasoning | `ollama pull llama3.2-vision` |

> **Note:** Tool calling requires a model that supports function calling. Recommended local models: `qwen2.5-coder`, `llama3.3`, `mistral`, `phi4`.

> **OpenAI newer models (gpt-5 / o3 / o4 family):** These models require `max_completion_tokens` instead of the legacy `max_tokens` parameter. CheetahClaws handles this automatically — no configuration needed.

> **Reasoning models:** `deepseek-r1`, `qwen3`, and `gemma4` stream native `<think>` blocks. Enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking` to see thoughts in the terminal. Note: models fed a large system prompt (like cheetahclaws's 25 tool schemas) may suppress their thinking phase to avoid breaking the expected JSON format — this is model behavior, not a bug.

## Installation

### Quick Install (one command)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SafeRL-Lab/cheetahclaws/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or

```
pip install cheetahclaws
```

Works on **Linux, macOS, WSL2, and Android (Termux)**. The installer handles everything: checks Python 3.10+, clones the repo, installs via pip, and adds `cheetahclaws` to your PATH.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc     # macOS (zsh)
# or: source ~/.bashrc   # Linux (bash)
cheetahclaws        # start chatting!
```

First run will guide you through setup (pick provider, set API key). Or run `cheetahclaws --setup` anytime.

> **Windows:** Native Windows is not supported. Install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and run the command above inside WSL.
>
> **Android / Termux:** The installer auto-detects Termux and skips incompatible optional dependencies. Manual install: `pkg install python git && pip install cheetahclaws`.

---

### Alternative: install with `pip`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/cheetahclaws.git
cd cheetahclaws
pip install .
```

After that, `cheetahclaws` is available as a global command:

```bash
cheetahclaws                        # start REPL
cheetahclaws --model gpt-4o         # choose a model
cheetahclaws -p "explain this"      # non-interactive
cheetahclaws --setup                # re-run setup wizard
```

To update after pulling new code:

```bash
cd cheetahclaws
git pull
pip install --force-reinstall .
```

> **Upgrading from a pre-2026-05-08 install?** If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prompts'` (or `modular.trading.discover`, etc.) at startup, your existing wheel is from before the issue #97 packaging fix and is missing several sub-packages. `pip install --force-reinstall .` rebuilds and ships them all — see [#97](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/cheetahclaws/issues/97) for the root-cause writeup.

pip install ".[all]"                # everything above
```

> **Note:** After installing `[browser]`, run `playwright install chromium` to download the browser binary.
---

### Alternative: install with `uv`

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installs `cheetahclaws` into an isolated environment and puts it on your PATH:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install with all optional dependencies (voice, vision, autosuggest, browser, files, OCR, trading etc.)
git clone https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/cheetahclaws.git
cd cheetahclaws
uv tool install ".[all]"
```

Prefer a minimal install? Use `uv tool install .` (core only) and add extras later, e.g. `uv tool install ".[voice,vision,autosuggest]" --reinstall`.

To update: `uv tool install ".[all]" --reinstall`

To uninstall: `uv tool uninstall cheetahclaws`

---

### Alternative: run directly from source (no install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/cheetahclaws.git
cd cheetahclaws
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cheetahclaws.py
```

This is useful for development — changes take effect immediately without reinstalling.

---

## Usage: Open-Source Models (Local)

### Option A — Ollama (Recommended)

Ollama runs models locally with zero configuration. No API key required.

**Step 1: Install Ollama**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Or download from https://ollama.com/download
```

**Step 2: Pull a model**

```bash
# Best for coding (recommended)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder          # 4.7 GB (7B)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b      # 19 GB (32B)

# General purpose
ollama pull llama3.3               # 42 GB (70B)
ollama pull llama3.2               # 2.0 GB (3B)

# Reasoning
ollama pull deepseek-r1            # 4.7 GB (7B)
ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b        # 19 GB (32B)

# Other
ollama pull phi4                   # 9.1 GB (14B)
ollama pull mistral                # 4.1 GB (7B)
```

**Step 3: Start Ollama server** (runs automatically on macOS; on Linux run manually)

```bash
ollama serve     # starts on http://localhost:11434
```

**Step 4: Run cheetahclaws**

```bash
cheetahclaws --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
cheetahclaws --model ollama/llama3.3
cheetahclaws --model ollama/deepseek-r1
```

Or

```bash
python cheetahclaws.py --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
python cheetahclaws.py --model ollama/llama3.3
python cheetahclaws.py --model ollama/deepseek-r1
python cheetahclaws.py --model ollama/qwen3.5:35b
```

**List your locally available models:**

```bash
ollama list
```

Then use any model from the list:

```bash
cheetahclaws --model ollama/<model-name>
```

---

### Option B — LM Studio

LM Studio provides a GUI to download and run models, with a built-in OpenAI-compatible server.

**Step 1:** Download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and install it.

**Step 2:** Search and download a model inside LM Studio (GGUF format).

**Step 3:** Go to **Local Server** tab → click **Start Server** (default port: 1234).

**Step 4:**

```bash
cheetahclaws --model lmstudio/<model-name>
# e.g.:
cheetahclaws --model lmstudio/phi-4-GGUF
cheetahclaws --model lmstudio/qwen2.5-coder-7b
```

The model name should match what LM Studio shows in the server status bar.

---

### Option C — vLLM / Self-Hosted OpenAI-Compatible Server

For self-hosted inference servers (vLLM, TGI, llama.cpp server, etc.) that expose an OpenAI-compatible API:

Quick Start for option C:
Step 1: Start vllm:
 ```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
      --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \
      --host 0.0.0.0 \
      --port 8000 \
      --enable-auto-tool-choice \
      --tool-call-parser hermes
```


 Step 2: Start cheetahclaws：
```
  export CUSTOM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
  export CUSTOM_API_KEY=none
  cheetahclaws --model custom/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct
```


```bash
# Example: vLLM serving Qwen2.5-Coder-32B
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct \
    --port 8000 \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --tool-call-parser hermes

# Then run cheetahclaws pointing to your server:
cheetahclaws
```

Inside the REPL:

```
/config custom_base_url=http://localhost:8000/v1
/config custom_api_key=token-abc123    # skip if no auth
/model custom/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct
```

Or set via environment:

```bash
export CUSTOM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
export CUSTOM_API_KEY=token-abc123

cheetahclaws --model custom/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct
```

For a remote GPU server:

```bash
/config custom_base_url=http://192.168.1.100:8000/v1
/model custom/your-model-name
```

---

## Model Name Format

Three equivalent formats are supported:

```bash
# 1. Auto-detect by prefix (works for well-known models)
cheetahclaws --model gpt-4o
cheetahclaws --model gemini-2.0-flash
cheetahclaws --model deepseek-chat

# 2. Explicit provider prefix with slash
cheetahclaws --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
cheetahclaws --model kimi/moonshot-v1-128k

# 3. Explicit provider prefix with colon (also works)
cheetahclaws --model kimi:moonshot-v1-32k
cheetahclaws --model qwen:qwen-max
```

**Auto-detection rules:**

| Model prefix | Detected provider |
|---|---|
| `claude-` | anthropic |
| `gpt-`, `o1`, `o3` | openai |
| `gemini-` | gemini |
| `moonshot-`, `kimi-` | kimi |
| `qwen`, `qwq-` | qwen |
| `glm-` | zhipu |
| `deepseek-` | deepseek |
| `MiniMax-`, `minimax-`, `abab` | minimax |
| `llama`, `mistral`, `phi`, `gemma`, `mixtral`, `codellama` | ollama |

---

## Trading Agent

CheetahClaws includes a built-in AI-powered trading analysis and backtesting module. Install trading dependencies:

```bash
pip install "cheetahclaws[trading]"
```

### Multi-agent analysis

```bash
/trading analyze NVDA
```

Runs a 5-phase pipeline: **data collection** (technical indicators, fundamentals, news) → **Bull/Bear researcher debate** → **research judge** recommendation → **risk management panel** (aggressive / conservative / neutral) → **portfolio manager** final decision with a 5-tier rating: `BUY / OVERWEIGHT / HOLD / UNDERWEIGHT / SELL`.

Each agent uses BM25 memory to recall similar past situations and learns from outcomes via post-trade reflection.

### Backtesting

```bash
/trading backtest AAPL dual_ma           # single strategy
/trading backtest TSLA                   # AI picks best strategy
```

4 built-in strategies: `dual_ma` (SMA crossover), `rsi_mean_reversion`, `bollinger_breakout`, `macd_crossover`. Engines for US/HK equities and crypto. Reports Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, max drawdown, win rate, profit factor.

### SSJ integration

`/ssj` → **14. 📈 Trading** opens a guided sub-menu:

| Option | Action |
|---|---|
| a. Quick Analyze | Full multi-agent analysis for any symbol |
| b. Backtest | Pick strategy or compare all 4 |
| c. Price Check | Current price + key metrics |
| d. Indicators | 11 technical indicators report |
| e. Trading Bot | Autonomous multi-symbol analysis |
| f. History | Past trading decisions |
| g. Memory | Trading memory status |

### Supported markets

US stocks (`AAPL`), HK stocks (`0700.HK`), A-shares (`000001.SZ`), crypto (`BTC`, `ETH`, + 18 more). Data sources with automatic fallback chains — no API keys required.

## Web UI

A production-ready browser interface with real user accounts, SQLite-backed session history, and ops endpoints — bundled Python stdlib HTTP server plus nine small vanilla-JS modules, no Node.js / React / build step.

### Install and start

```bash
pip install 'cheetahclaws[web]'              # pulls sqlalchemy + bcrypt + PyJWT

cheetahclaws --web                           # auto-picks a free port (tries 8080 first)
cheetahclaws --web --port 9000               # bind exactly :9000 (fails loudly if taken)
cheetahclaws --web --host 0.0.0.0            # open to the local network
cheetahclaws --web --no-auth                 # skip login (localhost dev only)
```

On first visit to `http://localhost:<port>/chat`, the UI routes you to a **registration form** — the first account becomes admin. Subsequent visits show **Sign in**. Credentials: bcrypt-hashed password + 7-day JWT cookie (`ccjwt`, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict). The JWT signing key is persisted to `~/.cheetahclaws/web_secret` so logins survive restarts.

### Chat UI (`/chat`)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Streaming chat** | WebSocket for live prompts + SSE for long-running slash commands |
| **Persistent history** | Every session + message lives in SQLite (`~/.cheetahclaws/web.db`). Server restart does not lose state. |
| **Sidebar session management** | Title auto-titled from first user message, relative time ("12m ago"), message count, busy dot, client-side search, right-click menu (Rename / Export Markdown / Delete) |
| **Cross-user isolation** | Each user only sees their own sessions — enforced at DB query and in-memory cache |
| **Tool cards** | Collapsible cards show tool name, inputs, outputs, status (running / done / denied) |
| **Permission approval** | Inline Allow / Deny buttons |
| **45+ slash commands** | `/status`, `/model`, `/brainstorm`, `/ssj`, `/plan`, `/telegram`, `/wechat`, `/slack`, `/voice`, `/image`, etc. |
| **Settings panel** | Model picker (11 providers), permission mode, thinking/verbose toggles, per-provider API key entry, quick-action buttons |
| **Theme** | Light default, `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` follows the OS automatically. Toggle cycles **system → light → dark → system**; choice stored in localStorage, no flash-of-wrong-theme on first paint |
| **Feature dashboard** | Welcome screen with 4×6 clickable cards — Core, Agent Features, Session & Memory, Multi-Model, Development Tools, Bridges, Multi-Modal Media |
| **Export as Markdown** | `GET /api/sessions/{id}/export` downloads the conversation with all tool calls |
| **Favicon** | Leaping-cheetah icon served at `/favicon.ico` and `/static/favicon.png` |

### PTY Terminal (`/`)

Full xterm.js terminal — still there, still 100% CLI parity. Uses the same one-time generated password (printed on startup) — separate from the chat JWT flow.

### API shape

```
Browser ──→ /chat                ──→ 9 JS modules load from /static/js/*.js
        ──→ /api/auth/login      ──→ bcrypt + JWT cookie
        ──→ /api/prompt (POST)   ──→ persists to SQLite, fans events out
        ──→ /api/events (WS)     ──→ real-time text_chunk / tool_* / permission_*
        ──→ /api/sessions/*      ──→ list / get / rename / delete / export

        ──→ /                     ──→ xterm.js PTY (password-gated)
        ──→ /health               ──→ { ok, db, uptime_s }        (unauthenticated)
        ──→ /metrics              ──→ Prometheus text              (unauthenticated)
```

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/auth/bootstrap` | GET | Any users registered yet? |
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | Create user (first one is admin) |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Verify bcrypt + issue JWT cookie |
| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | Clear cookie |
| `/api/auth/whoami` | GET | Current user |
| `/api/prompt` | POST | Submit prompt / slash command (inline JSON or SSE for long commands) |
| `/api/events` | WS | Structured event stream for a session |
| `/api/approve` | POST | Respond to a permission request |
| `/api/sessions` | GET | List this user's sessions |
| `/api/sessions/{id}` | GET / PATCH / DELETE | Detail / rename / remove |
| `/api/sessions/{id}/export` | GET | Download conversation as Markdown |
| `/api/config` | GET / PATCH | Read or update session config |
| `/api/models` | GET | Providers + models + API-key status |
| `/health` | GET | Liveness + DB probe |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus counters (`requests_total`, `auth_logins_failed`, `users_total`, ...) |

### Observability

- **Structured logs** — one JSON line per HTTP response on stderr, e.g.
  ```json
  {"ts":1776368300.054,"level":"info","logger":"web.server","msg":"req","method":"POST","path":"/api/prompt","status":200,"dur_ms":650,"user_id":1}
  ```
  Tune with `CHEETAHCLAWS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO|WARNING`.
- **Metrics** — point Prometheus at `/metrics`. Counters increment inside `_send_http` and the auth routes.
- **Tests** — `pytest tests/test_web_api.py` runs 21 end-to-end HTTP tests against a real server in ~5 seconds (no mocks, real SQLite, real bcrypt, real JWT).

> **Full guide:** [docs/guides/web-ui.md](docs/guides/web-ui.md)

### Docker / Home Server

For headless deployments (home server with local Ollama, cloud VM, container host) the repo ships a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. The web UI plus any configured Telegram / WeChat / Slack bridge run together in a single container:

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # set UID/GID and any cloud API keys
mkdir -p workspace data
docker compose up -d --build
# open http://<host-ip>:8080/chat
```

The container reaches an Ollama instance running on the host via `host.docker.internal:11434`. Mount `./workspace` into the container and share it over Samba to access the agent's working files from your phone or other PCs.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add an MCP server?**

Option 1 — via REPL (stdio server):
```
/mcp add git uvx mcp-server-git
```

Option 2 — create `.mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {"type": "stdio", "command": "uvx", "args": ["mcp-server-git"]}
  }
}
```

Then run `/mcp reload` or restart. Use `/mcp` to check connection status.

**Q: An MCP server is showing an error. How do I debug it?**

```
/mcp                    # shows error message per server
/mcp reload git         # try reconnecting
```

If the server uses stdio, make sure the command is in your `$PATH`:
```bash
which uvx               # should print a path
uvx mcp-server-git      # run manually to see errors
```

**Q: Can I use MCP servers that require authentication?**

For HTTP/SSE servers with a Bearer token:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://myserver.example.com/sse",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer sk-my-token"}
    }
  }
}
```

For stdio servers with env-based auth:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-brave-search"],
      "env": {"BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-key"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Q: Tool calls don't work with my local Ollama model.**

Not all models support function calling. Use one of the recommended tool-calling models: `qwen2.5-coder`, `llama3.3`, `mistral`, or `phi4`.

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder
cheetahclaws --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
```

**Q: How do I connect to a remote GPU server running vLLM?**

```
/config custom_base_url=http://your-server-ip:8000/v1
/config custom_api_key=your-token
/model custom/your-model-name
```

**Q: How do I check my API cost?**

```
/cost

  Input tokens:  3,421
  Output tokens:   892
  Est. cost:     $0.0648 USD
```

**Q: Can I use multiple API keys in the same session?**

Yes. Set all the keys you need upfront (via env vars or `/config`). Then switch models freely — each call uses the key for the active provider.

**Q: How do I make a model available across all projects?**

Add keys to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Set the default model in `~/.cheetahclaws/config.json`:

```json
{ "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
```

**Q: Qwen / Zhipu returns garbled text.**

Ensure your `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` / `ZHIPU_API_KEY` is correct and the account has sufficient quota. Both providers use UTF-8 and handle Chinese well.

**Q: Can I pipe input to cheetahclaws?**

```bash
echo "Explain this file" | cheetahclaws --print --accept-all
cat error.log | cheetahclaws -p "What is causing this error?"
```

**Q: How do I run it as a CLI tool from anywhere?**

Use `uv tool install` — it creates an isolated environment and puts `cheetahclaws` on your PATH:

```bash
cd cheetahclaws
uv tool install ".[all]"
```

After that, just run `cheetahclaws` from any directory. To update after pulling changes, run `uv tool install ".[all]" --reinstall`. For a minimal install, use `uv tool install .` and add extras as needed.

**Q: How do I set up voice input?**

```bash
# Minimal setup (local, offline, no API key):
pip install sounddevice faster-whisper numpy

# Then in the REPL:
/voice status          # verify backends are detected
/voice                 # speak your prompt
```

On first use, `faster-whisper` downloads the `base` model (~150 MB) automatically.
Use a larger model for better accuracy: `export NANO_CLAUDE_WHISPER_MODEL=small`

**Q: Voice input transcribes my words wrong (misses coding terms).**

The keyterm booster already injects coding vocabulary from your git branch and project files.
For persistent domain terms, put them in a `.cheetahclaws/voice_keyterms.txt` file (one term per line) — this is checked automatically on each recording.

**Q: Can I use voice input in Chinese / Japanese / other languages?**

Yes. Set the language before recording:

```
/voice lang zh    # Mandarin Chinese
/voice lang ja    # Japanese
/voice lang auto  # reset to auto-detect (default)
```

Whisper supports 99 languages. `auto` detection works well but explicit codes improve accuracy for short utterances.
